Why is that masking limited to entering/exiting the guest? I would have
though that it would have been put in the kvm_call_hyp helper, in order
to cover all "HYP" accesses. Or is it that you've worked out that only
the guest run actually requires this because none of the other HYP
helpers are changing the flags?

Thanks,
