Yes, this looks much more palatable than my initial approach. I'll use that.

We could. Not sure that's a big deal though.

You could be on a system with a mix of affected and non-affected CPUs,
and the capability only tells you that at least one of the CPUs is
affected. For the non affected CPUs, we won't have a slot (since there
is no workaround to provide), unless we actually allocated one.
