Thanks Jintack! I was able to test L2 boot up with these instructions.

Next, I will try to run some simple tests. Any suggestions on reducing the L2 bootup
time in my test setup ? I think I will try to make the L2 kernel print
less messages; and maybe just get rid of some of the userspace services.
I also applied the patch to reduce the timer frequency btw.
