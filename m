I have no idea what you want to introduce here.  If you have an idea on
how to improve the code, patches are welcome.

Please keep in mind, that the purpose of this patch is to move code
around to improve the GIC handling performance, not changing the
lower-level details of the code.

Not sure what the 'default' values are.

Your suggestion below would require us to maintain elrsr when we setup
list registers, and I don't really see the benefit.

I don't understand your suggestion.  As you will see later, we will get
rid of storing the elrsr completely with a measureable performance
improvement.

If you think you can improve the code beyond that, a follow-up patch
would be most welcome.

Note that on all the implementations I'm familiar with, the maximum
number of LRs is four, so we're not wading through massive bitmaps in
practice here.
