This would have been my preferred approach but the libc community were
not entirely happy with it as it breaks POSIX compatibility:

https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16437
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-February/323348.html

(there are other threads around x32 and people arguing whether POSIX is
wrong)

Some sometime around version 4 or 5 of this series, we made the move
(back) to compat-like ABI.
