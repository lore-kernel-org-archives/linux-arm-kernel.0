Please format the text nicely, and try to simplify the message when
resubmitting these patches.  I hope it will be easier for you to write
a meaningful commit message if you split these patches into multiple
ones.

One specific thing currently lacking from the commit message is a
discussion of why this API is needed in the first place - why can't we
reuse KVM_SET_ONE_REG, for example.

Dongjiu, I can read the code, of course.  My comment was to tell you
that the text you add to the api.txt file should be meaningful and
explanatory on its own; that's the whole point of having such a file.

What if userspace wants to drive a CPU reset of some form.  Is there any
mechanism for resetting the register then?

Please consider the migration point for your next version as well.
