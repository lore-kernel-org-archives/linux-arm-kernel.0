I've had a look through this; a mix of typo corrections
and other questions below. I'm not very familiar with the ITS
so mostly it's requests for clarification...

I think we should say "must be zero, or the call fails with -ESOMETHING",
so we have the option of using attr for something in future if needed.

should this be "in the MAPD command" ?

Probably clearer as != 0, since it's a field rather than a pointer.

The MAPD command lets the guest specify bits [50:8] of
ITT address -- any reason for not storing bits [50:49] here?
(in fact you can see the format of MAPD has more reserved
bits for wider physical address sizes in future -- should
we be trying to future proof our format too?)

I don't see anything in the spec for MAPD that forbids the guest
from using physical address 0 as the ITT_addr, though maybe I
missed it.

We should document the meanings of the CTE fields here.

This seems to be missing some of the fields in the suggested
ITE contents in the GIC spec table 6-3. Is that OK?
In particular it's missing the virtual-interrupt related fields.
Is pINTID==0 really not a valid interrupt ID value?


These CTE/ITE/DTE formats don't seem to have any kind of
"escape hatch" for allowing backwards compatible extensions
to the format. Do we need one? (I think that's particularly
likely to be useful where there's an ITS feature we don't
currently implement but might perhaps want to in future,
like GICv4 virtual interrupt injection.)
