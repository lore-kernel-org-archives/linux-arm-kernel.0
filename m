The above works fine for new support, or for new platforms.

There's still support being migrated from platform code to DT, which
requires three steps:
  1. New DT-aware driver support,
  2. DT update to use the new driver support,
  3. Clean up platform code after optional DTB backwards compatibility
     grace period,
To make matters worse, 1 may conflict with the existing platform code,
and 2 must sometimes not be done before 1. Hence you may need three kernel
releases.
So we're already planning now what to clean up for v4.15 ;-)

Would it be acceptable to do step 2 in the same release, after the driver
support has entered in -rc1? I know this is more than just replacing
numbers by symbolic values.

Thanks!

Gr{oetje,eeting}s,

                        Geert
