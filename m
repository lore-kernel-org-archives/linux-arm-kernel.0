A load and a conditional.  But what I really wanted to also avoid was
the function call from the main run loop, which I neglected as well.  I
think I can achieve that with a static inline wrapper in the arch timer
header file which first evaluates the static key and then calls into the
arch timer code.

That's a neat idea.  The only problem is that creating a new VM would
then flip the static key, and then we'd have to flip it back when a vgic
is created on that VM, and I don't particularly like the idea of doing
this too often.

What I'd suggest then is to have two versions of the function:
irqchip_in_kernel() which is what it is today, and then
__irqchip_in_kernel() which can only be called from within the critical
path of the run loop, so that we can increment the static key on
kvm_vcpu_first_run_init() when we don't have a VGIC.

How does that sound?

Thanks,
