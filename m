If Qemu/kvmtool wants to emulate a machine that notifies the guest about
firmware-first RAS Errors using SError/SEI, it needs to decide when to send
these SError and what ESR to specify.


> now do you want to specify an impdef ESR in KVM instead of usrspace?

No, that patch is just trying to fixup the existing cases where KVM already
injects an SError. I'm just trying to keep the behaviour the-same:

Before the RAS Extensions the guest would always get an impdef SError ESR.
After the RAS Extensions KVM has to pick an ESR, as otherwise the guest gets the
hardware-reset value of VSESR_EL2. On the FVP this is all-zeros, which is a RAS
encoding. That patch changes it to still be an impdef SError ESR.


> if setting the vsesr_el2 in the KVM, whether user-space need to specify?

I think we need a KVM CAP API to do this. With that patch it can be wired into
pend_guest_serror(), which takes the ESR to make pending if the CPU supports it.

It's not clear to me whether its useful for user-space to make an SError pending
even if it can't set the ESR....

We need to get some of the wider issues fixed first, the big-ugly one is
memory_failure_queue() not being NMI safe. (this isn't a problem for SEA as this
would only become re-entrant if the kernel text was corrupt). It is a problem
for SEI and SDEI.

Aha, thanks for this:

Masked for the CPU because the CPU can deliver the SError to EL3.

What about software? Code at EL1 and EL2 each have a PSTATE.A bit they may have
set. HCR_EL2.VSE respects EL1's PSTATE.A ... the question is does your firmware
respect the PSTATE.A value of the exception level that SError are routed to?

HCR_EL2.TEA covers synchronous-external-aborts. For SError you need to check
HCR_EL2.AMO. Some crazy hypervisor may set one and not the other.

The EC value in the ELR describes current/lower exception level, you need to
re-encode this for EL2 if the exception came from EL2.

This SError came from EL2. You _must_ check SPSR_EL3.A is clear before returning
to the EL2 SError vector.

EL2 believes it has masked SError, it does this because it can't handle one
right now. If your firmware jumps in anyway - its game over.

We mask SError in entry.S when we take an exception and when we return from an
exception. This is so that we can read/write the ELR/SPSR without them changing
under our feet. If your firmware overwrites these values - we've lost them, and
can never return to the context we interrupted.


> (2) if HCR_EL2.TEA

It's an SError, these are routed by HCR_EL2.AMO.


> is set to 0, SError come from host EL1 ,EL0, copy ELR_EL3 to ELR_EL1,ESR_EL3 to ESR_EL1

Again, the EC needs re-encoding.

What if the SError came from EL2 and HCR_EL2.AMO is clear. This means SError are
routed to EL1, and are implicitly masked when executing at EL2.

This is the same SError-is-masked issue as above.

What does your firmware do when physical SError is masked and you want to hand
it an SEI notification?


You need to route your fake-SError based on HCR_EL2.AMO and your
fake-External-Abort based on HCR_EL2.TEA.

You also need a triage step at EL3 before you try and notify the normal world.
If you take an uncontainable error to EL3 there is very little point telling the
OS - its probably already on fire. In this case firmware needs to reboot the
machine, and generate a summary of the error for the BERT.


Thanks,

James
