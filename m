What I'd really like is to apply that patch knowing that:

- you have checked that with a released version of the compiler, you
don't observe any absolute address in any of the objects that are going
to be executed at EL2 on a mainline kernel,

- you have successfully run guests with a mainline kernel,

- it works for a reasonable set of common kernel configurations
(defconfig and some of the most useful debug options),

- I can reproduce your findings with the same released compiler.

Is that the case? I don't think any of the above is completely outlandish.
