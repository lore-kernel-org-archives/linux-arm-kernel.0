Let's consider an example.  Imagine a 4MB region (1024 4K pages) start
at 0, and we want to ensure that the address is within one of the 2MB
pages.

That means, size will be:

  size = 1024 * 4096 = 4194304
  uaddr_start = 0
  uaddr_end = 0 + 4194304 = 4194304

and the comparison check for anything in the first 2MB region becomes

      return 0 >= 0 && 2097152 <= 4194304;

which is what we want.

The comparison check for anything in the second 2MB region becomes

      return 2097152 >= 0 && 4194304 <= 4194304;

which is also what we want.

If we had done a stricly less than or subtracted one from uaddr_end this
check would fail, which we don't want.

Am I missing something?

I prefer the way the code is written now, because logging active is a
logically very separate concept from checking the boundaries, and this
is realy the slow path anyway, so not sure there's any measurable
benefit.

More generally, I'd like user_mem_abort() to become more like:

if (check1())
   conditionr1 = value;
if (check2())
   condition2 = value;
if (check3())
   condition3 = value;

manipulate_page_tables(condition1, condition2, condition3, ...);

And I'll have a got at that following Punit's PUD huge pages.
