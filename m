Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Improve and add tracepoints for KVM on arm/arm64
Message-ID: <1440942922-23955-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The timer and vgic code didn't have tracepoints for quite a while and
we've been adding those ad-hoc when doing development a lot of times.
Add some simple tracepoints for those parts of KVM to get the
infrastructure in place.

Also improve the kvm_exit tracepoint on arm/arm64 to print something
meaningful and be much less misleading compared to what we have now.

This series depends on the "Rework architected timer and fix UEFI reset"
series sent earlier.  It is also available here:

I borrowed some of this code from Alex Benn?e, thanks!
