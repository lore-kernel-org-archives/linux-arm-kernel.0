Sure, asserted works for me. Or maybe istatus?

Right, and the reason we have 2 fields is to get us exit-less (and
easier) updates whenever we can. In most cases, taking the assertion
down will coincide with an MMIO exit to user space for an EOI for example.

Somewhere in between in the development I had a version that explicitly
triggered a KVM_EXIT for every state change of the timer. But that gets
messy very quickly. You need to update the state change before an MMIO
for example, otherwise a sequence like

  * set cval to future (which in turns sets istatus=0)
  * read gic pending state

will give you bogus results, as the mmio read to user space did not yet
have the timer status updated. And I really didn't want to wrap my head
around restarting MMIO exits ;).

So having this side channel where user space potentially expects a timer
status change on every exit is much cleaner.

Yes, it can, and it does. That's what the "kernel_timer_pending" field is.

The kernel however also needs to know whether user space's view is in
sync, because we don't know whether there was an exit between our
internal state change and the guest entry. That's what the
"user_timer_pending" field is for.

Yes, but if we can we want to piggy-back on an existing exit.

Because we need to make sure that the cpu IRQ line is updated before we
enter the guest. Otherwise we might get spurious interrupts.

Yes, but we can't exit straight away with our own exit reason because we
might be inside an MMIO exit path here which already occupies the
exit_reason.

Hm, so you're saying we should just update kernel_timer_pending in
flush_hwstate()? That way we miss out on the piggy backing, no?

All functions in the arch timer file are in normal C API notion
(0=success). I actually had it all in exit-related API notion at first
and it became very awkward and hard to read to convert exit codes in
between. Doing it just once in kvm.c felt much cleaner.

So how would user space know whether the line went up or down? Or didn't
change at all (if we coalesce with an MMIO exit)?

That's probably a very useful cleanup, yes :).
