Strictly speaking, I think this is marginally more stringent than what
the ARM ARM describes. My reading is that the "Misprogramming of the
Contiguous bit" rules only apply when there are multiple valid entries,
and hence if you had a contiguous span with only a single valid entry
(and TLBs up-to-date), you could modify that in-place so long as you
followed the usual BBM rules.

However, I don't see us ever (deliberately) doing that, given it would
require more work, and there's no guarantee that the CPU would consider
the whole span as being mapped. It's also possible my reading of the ARM
ARM is flawed.

Thanks,
Mark.
