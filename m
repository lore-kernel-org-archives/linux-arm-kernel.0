ok, consider this case:

    reg = 0x55555555 55555555;

    CPU 0                CPU 1
    -----                -----
    tmp = reg;
                         tmp = reg;
    tmp[63:32] = ~0;
                         tmp[31:0] = 0;
    reg = tmp;
                         reg = tmp;

    print("reg is %x", reg);
      /* reg is 0x55555555 00000000 */

which is weird, because I think in hardware you'll get:
    0xffffffff 00000000

no matter how you order the two 32-bit updates.

That is, unless the architecture tells us that you could observe the
above behavior.

that's why I started with a distributor lock, but you talked my out of
it on IRC.  I'll just change this patch to introduce the distributor
lock.  It's ok to have that as long as we don't grab it all over, which
we won't.

I'll think about this.

Thanks for doing that.  It should be trivial to verify that this works
with a dedicated distributor lock as well though.

Thanks,
