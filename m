The point of this seems to be to use non-posted mappings for both I/O
port space and ECAM (config) space.  So I think the most readable way
would be to have generic definitions like this:

  #ifndef ioremap_nopost
  #define ioremap_nopost ioremap_nocache
  #endif

  #ifndef pgprot_nonposted
  #define pgprot_nonposted(prot) pgprot_noncached(prot)
  #endif

and let ARM/ARM64 implement their own versions of those.  Then the
devm code might fit naturally in lib/devres.c, e.g.,

  void __iomem *devm_ioremap_nopost(...) { ... }

and we probably wouldn't need the pci_remap_cfgspace() wrapper, e.g.,
we could do:

  return ioremap_page_range(..., pgprot_nonposted(PAGE_KERNEL));

  cfg->win = ioremap_nopost(...);

But I might be oversimplifying things.

BTW, I tried to apply the v1 series on my "master" branch (v4.11-rc1)
and patch 19 didn't apply cleanly.  It's trivial and I can fix it up
by hand, so not really a problem, just FYI.
