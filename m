Oh CRIU. Yikes. I'd like the get/set to be gated by the CONFIG, yes.
No reason to allow explicit access to the key (and selected algo) if
we don't have to.

As for per-thread or not, having a "pick a new key now" prctl() sounds
good, but I'd like to have an eye toward having it just be "automatic"
on clone().
