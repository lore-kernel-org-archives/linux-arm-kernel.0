Right, in my tree the code is tailored to use the other patch you're
referencing but having received no 'ack' for it yet I made this set
for 32 bit only (aside from the 64bit flags in Kconfig).  As such you
don't need https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/3/677 for this to compile and
run.

Things have changed in the driver (and accessor functions) since I
wrote this Kconfig condition - Let me think on the above 2 comments.

I was not aware that "bitmap_scnprintf()" had disappeared - thanks for
pointing this out.  Did you mean cross-compile from an x86_64 host or
compile for a x86_64 target?  I don't get how you could have in the
latter case.

Thanks for the review,
Mathieu
