Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] QEMU support for KVM Guest Debug on arm64
Message-ID: <1427816446-31586-1-git-send-email-alex.bennee@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi,

I thought I'd sent V1 to the list but apparently not. Anyway this
patch series provides the QEMU side of guest debug support for arm64.
I'm assuming the first patch will be dropped when a proper merge of
the linux-headers is done once the kernel side is upstreamed.

There is nothing particularly special about the implementation details
although some of the bit-fiddling is a little fiddly.

GIT Repos:

The patch series is based off a recent master and can be found at:

https://github.com/stsquad/qemu
branch: kvm/guest-debug-v2

The kernel patches for this series are based off a v4.0-rc6 and can be
found at:

https://git.linaro.org/people/alex.bennee/linux.git
branch: guest-debug/4.0-rc6-v2

  linux-headers: partial sync from my kernel tree (DEV)
  target-arm: kvm - implement software breakpoints
  target-arm: kvm - support for single step
  target-arm: kvm - add support for HW assisted debug
