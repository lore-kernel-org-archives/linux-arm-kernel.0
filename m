It is not a quirk. It is actually recommended in the SBSA spec. The
patch is ugly because we can't do the right thing on the one platform
that actually implemented ARM's own recommendation (we can't tell the
bloody firmware to stop overriding our DT).

I would otherwise have added a "arm,use-sbsa-aliasing" property (or
something similar) instead of trying to guess things...
