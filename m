Well, that poses the question of what we emulate. We expose the
emulation of an ITS, hence no direct access to the LPI space. What we
could do would be allow LPI injection if not ITS is instantiated in the
kernel. But a mix of the two is likely to in contradiction with the
architecture.

I'm afraid this is not enough. A write to GICR_TRANSLATER (DID+EID)
results in a (LPI,CPU) pair. Can you easily express the CPU part in
irqfd (this is a genuine question, I'm not familiar enough with that
part of the core)?

It may be interesting to find out what would be the implications if we
were to put it in userspace.

The obvious one would be that we'd have to duplicate the code in both
QEMU and kvmtool, and I don't think anyone fancies that. Another concern
would be the support of GICv4, which relies on the command queue
handling to be handled in the kernel (the GICv4 handling is basically a
command translation system, and I'm not prepared to let userspace inject
commands in the host ITS).

Thanks,
