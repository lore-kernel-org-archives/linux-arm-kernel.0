Well, I was more concerned about the reliability part in there and all
the corner cases. Not sure if anyone actually tested this from within a
guest.

Yeah, so by now I have something which doesn't look too bad. Copied your
style with many comments ;-)

I will now clean up the patches and try to send something out still
today. I think by now there are significantly enough changes to justify
a new revision, even if I haven't addressed every single bit of the
comments yet.

Cheers,
Andre.

P.S. There be dragons:
char device redirected to /dev/pts/0 (label serial0)
[  193.035693] Kernel panic - not syncing: HYP panic:
....

Probably due to the ->nr_lr rework, about to investigate now.
