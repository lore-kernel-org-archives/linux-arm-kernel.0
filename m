No, HCR_EL2.NV is set, then we obviously get here, due to traps on _EL12
registers.

But if that wasn't the case (that's the time you'd be avaluating this
if-statement), then you're checking as part of the if-statement if the
virtual CPTR_EL2.TCPAC is set.  My question is, if the virtual
CPTR_EL2.TCPAC is not set, why would the physical one be set, which must
be the case if we're running this code, right?

I obviously meant *got* here.

Yes, but can this ever happen?
