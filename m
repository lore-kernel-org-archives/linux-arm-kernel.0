We also split up the regmap address space into two, one for the TM
registers, the other for the SROT registers. This was required to deal with
different address offsets for the TM and SROT registers across different
SoC families.

Since tsens-common.c/init_common() currently only registers one address
space, the order is important (TM before SROT). This is OK since the code
doesn't really use the SROT functionality yet.
