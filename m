Surely ARM64_VHE has always been default y?

We check for the configuration, but the penalty is severe (i.e., can't
create VMs) and it doesn't appear to make sense to put effort into
working around that: the user has an easy fix in the form of setting
ARM64_VHE=y.

Is there some value to supporting this configuration that I'm missing?
SVE and VHE are both default y.

I was concerned that the SVE and KVM initialisation might happen in
an unpredictable order.

KVM is initialised via module_init(), which I'm guessing is later than
cpufeatures (?)  If so then yes, kvm_arch_init() would be a reasonable
place to do this.

Is this still a problem if that configuration is forbidden by Kconfig?

Can you describe a scenario in which the problem config (KVM=y, VHE=n,
SVE=y) would be wanted?
