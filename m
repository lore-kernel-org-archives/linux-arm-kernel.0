Atomic add in x86 is actually a full barrier too. The performance 
difference between "lock add" and "lock xadd" should be minor. The 
additional load, however, could potentially cause an additional 
cacheline load on a contended lock. So do you see actual performance 
benefit of this change in ARM?
