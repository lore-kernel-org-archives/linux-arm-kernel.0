why are we hard-coding this to vcpu 0 ?

missing white space before the code block.  Where does the code block
belong exactly?

what do you mean with 'next' here?

also here, I don't understand what you mean by next.

Perhaps these comments were supposed to come before the function calls?

missing white space before this comment block as well, also here with
'subsequent' do you mean "At this point" ?

so this is all only valid for level-triggered interrupts?  Do we check
this somewhere along the call path?

I don't understand this.  Do we somehow know at this point that there is
a pending IRQ to inject as a virtual IRQ?

how do you know this is the case?  couldn't it be active in the LR?

then why do we bother setting them to anything here?

I'm beginning to understand what you mean by 'next' here.

Can you make it more explicit by saying "After this function returns, a
physical IRQ will be..." ?
