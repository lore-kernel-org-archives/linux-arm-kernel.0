Yes. Unfortunately, the assumption that kernel symbols live in the
same address space as dynamic allocations in the linear mapping is
widespread throughout the code base, otherwise we could strictly
separate the two, and this would not be necessary. I played around
with adding another sparse address space for kernel addresses, but
that gives a lot of hits in generic code as well.

Indeed. I did not mention it in the cover letter, but this work is
somewhat related to series I proposed which allows the kernel Image to
reside anywhere (i.e., at any 2 MB aligned offset + TEXT_OFFSET) in
physical memory. This is fairly straight forward once we have moved
the kernel virtual mapping out of the linear mapping, but since this
series has enough moving parts as it is, I omitted those pieces for
now.

After Mark Rutland proposed his pagetable rework series, a lot of
those changes became much easier to implement, but did require rework,
and because of queries I received personally regarding KASLR, I
decided to focus on that part first.

True. Catalin mentioned this as well in response to the series
mentioned above. Unmapping the kernel text in the linear mapping is an
important enhancement from security pov, but not essential from a
functionality pov.

I don't see a reason to use the same virtual and physical offset
(other than the conditional). On arm64, it would be up to the
bootloader to decide where to put the Image in physical memory, and it
would be up to the kernel to decide whether or not to virtually remap
itself.
