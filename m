The System Trace Macrocell (STM) is an IP block falling under the
CoreSight umbrella.  It's main purpose it so expose stimulus channels
to any system component for the purpose of information logging.

Bindings for this IP block adds a couple of items to the current
mandatory definition for CoreSight components.
