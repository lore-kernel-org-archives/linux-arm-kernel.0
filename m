Message-ID: <1370512763-32200-1-git-send-email-lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>

This patch is v3 of a previous posting:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2013-June/173464.html

v3 changes:

- added __refdata to spc_check_loaded pointer
- removed some exported symbols
- added node pointer check in vexpress_spc_init()

v2 changes:

- Dropped timeout interface patch
- Converted interfaces to non-timeout ones, integrated and retested
- Removed mutex used at init
- Refactored code to work around init sections warning
- Fixed two minor bugs

This patch series introduces support for the Versatile Express Serial
Power Controller (SPC) present in ARM Versatile Express TC2 core tiles.
SPC driver is a fundamental component of TC2 power management and allows
to carry out C-state management and DVFS for A15 and A7 clusters.

First patch provides changes required by SPC to comply with the
Versatile Express config API, second patch is the SPC driver implementation.

Code extensively exercised through CPUidle and CPUfreq power states and
operating point transitions.
