thank you for the comments.
In my current solution which I refer to ARM RAS spec(RAS_Extension_PRD03-PRDC-010953-32-0.pdf).
when the Guest OS triggers an SEI, it will firstly trap to EL3 firmware, El3 firmware records the error
info to the APEI table, then copy the ESR_EL3 ELR_EL3 to ESR_EL2 ELR_EL2 and transfers control to the
hypervisor, hypervisor delegates the error exception to EL1 guest OS by setting HCR_EL2.VSE to 1 and pass the
virtual SEI syndrome through vsesr_el2. The EL1 guest OS check the DISR_EL1 syndrome information to decide to
terminate the application, or do some other recovery action. because the HCR_EL2.AMO is set, so in fact, read
DISR_EL1, it returns the VDISR_EL2. and VDISR_EL2 is loaded from VSESR_EL2, so here I pass the virtual SEI
syndrome vsesr_el2.

please see the ARM spec example about SEI with ESB
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
? The firmware logs, triages, and delegates the error exception to the hypervisor. As the error came
from EL1, it does by faking an SError interrupt exception entry to EL2.
? Control transfers to the hypervisor?s delegated error recovery agent. It repeats the process of triaging
the error.
? The hypervisor delegates the error exception to EL1 by setting HCR_EL2.VSE to 1, and returns
control to the OS using ERET.
? Control returns to the OS, and the ESB instruction is re-executed.
? The physical asynchronous SError interrupt has been cleared, so it is not taken again.
? The PE sets VDISR_EL2.A to 1 and records the syndrome from VSESR_EL2 in VDISR_EL2.
? The SVC exception entry code completes, and then the OS checks DISR_EL1 for a deferred SError
interrupt.
? See the example code sequence in Error Synchronization Barrier.
? This in fact returns VDISR_EL2 because the HCR_EL2.AMO bit is set.
? Because this returns DISR_EL1.A set, the OS instead processes the error.
? Although the error exception was taken from EL1, the OS error recovery agent can use the
information that it was taken from the ESB instruction at the exception entry point to isolate
the error to the EL0 application and not affect the OS.
? The error has been logged, triaged, and contained to the EL0 application.

thanks for the question.
This is exit path, for the case that already an SError is pending.it should be overload VSESR_EL2 using
the esr_el2 in below situation, right?

int handle_exit(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_run *run,
                       int exception_index)
{
        exit_handle_fn exit_handler;

        if (ARM_SERROR_PENDING(exception_index)) {
                u8 hsr_ec = ESR_ELx_EC(kvm_vcpu_get_hsr(vcpu));

                /*
                 * HVC/SMC already have an adjusted PC, which we need
                 * to correct in order to return to after having
                 * injected the SError.
                 */
                if (hsr_ec == ESR_ELx_EC_HVC32 || hsr_ec == ESR_ELx_EC_HVC64 ||
                    hsr_ec == ESR_ELx_EC_SMC32 || hsr_ec == ESR_ELx_EC_SMC64) {
                        u32 adj =  kvm_vcpu_trap_il_is32bit(vcpu) ? 4 : 2;
                        *vcpu_pc(vcpu) -= adj;
                }

                kvm_inject_vabt(vcpu);
                return 1;
        }

For the reason that set vsesr_el2 using esr_el2, I have explained it in above.
do you mean below steps?

EL0/EL1 SEI ---> EL3 firmware ------> EL2 hypervisor notify the Qemu to inject VSError ------>Qemu call KVM API to inject VSError ---->KVM
