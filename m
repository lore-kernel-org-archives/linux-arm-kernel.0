Unused, so could have just left the inline version.

We shouldn't need to do this. The "preferred" target type isn't defined
well (that I know of), but IMO it should probably be the target that
best matches the host, minus optional features. The best base target. We
may use these features to convey that the preferred target should enable
some optional feature if that feature is necessary to workaround a bug,
i.e. using the "feature" bit as an erratum bit someday, but that'd be
quite a debatable use, so maybe not even that. Most likely we'll never
need to add features here.

That said, I think defining the feature bit makes sense. ATM, I'm feeling
like we'll want to model the user interface for SVE like PMU (using VCPU
device ioctls).

I guess sve_state can be pretty large. Should we allocate it like we
do the VM with kvm_arch_alloc_vm()? I.e. using vzalloc() on VHE machines?
