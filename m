I am leaning towards adding this to asm/memory.h

#ifdef CONFIG_KASAN
#define KASAN_SHADOW_SIZE (UL(1) << (VA_BITS - 3))
#else
#define KASAN_SHADOW_SIZE (0)
#endif

and remove the #ifdef CONFIG_KASAN block from asm/pgtable.h. Then
asm/kasan.h, which already includes asm/memory.h, can use it as region
size, and none of the reshuffling I had to do before is necessary.

I use mem= for this, in fact, and boot most of my machines and VMs
with some value slightly below the actual available DRAM that is not a
multiple of 2M
