I meant the code for x86:
	/* Reset the lowest_stack value for the next syscall */
	current->thread.lowest_stack = current_top_of_stack() - 256;

...Now when I'm writing about the performance impact, I see that I was wrong
about "huge". Excuse me.

Let me describe the implications of this code change.

So we are at the end of a syscall. We've just erased the used part of the kernel
stack. The current stack pointer is near to the top of stack. On x86_64 I see
that the stack pointer is stack top minus 56 bytes (just before switching onto
the trampoline stack).

I took the idea of resetting lowest_stack to stack top minus 256 from the
original PaX Team's code. It should give the speedup when lowest_stack is not
updated during a syscall (a lot of functions are not instrumented) and we start
to search for the poison value from that reasonable point.

If we speak about the common erase_kstack() code, this code change can break
x86, because this function can be called from the trampoline stack (separate
from the thread stack).

I think having register storage class specifier here is a bit better than
nothing. And yes, I'll add a comment. Right now don't see a better solution.

I guess it was a linkage error, right?

Looked through this big article about ARM, KVM and HYP mode:
https://lwn.net/Articles/557132/

So we have some limited amount of kernel code which runs in HYP mode. Is it only
in arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/ directory?

Mark, could you give a clue what trouble will we have if we call track_stack()
or check_alloca() from that code?

Thanks in advance!
