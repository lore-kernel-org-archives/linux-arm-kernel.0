On my box, with my fancy multi-phase seccomp patches, the total
seccomp overhead for a very short filter is about 13ns.  Adding a full
barrier would add several ns, I think.

Admittedly, this is x86, not ARM, so comparisons here are completely
bogus.  And that read memory barrier doesn't even need an instruction
on x86.  But still, let's try to keep this fast.
