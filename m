compat_alloc_user_space() is a hack that should go away too.  It ends
up copying the data three times.

The more efficient solution to this is to have a core syscall function
that only accesses kernel memory, and then have two front-end
functions (native and compat) that do the actual reads and writes to
userspace, with conversion in the compat case.
