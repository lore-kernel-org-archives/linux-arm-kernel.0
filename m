Sorry if I am nitpicking, but have you considered replacing this
beautiful piece of fine legalese with the new SPDX ids?
e.g. this:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0
// Copyright (C) 2014 ARM Ltd.

Or if this does not work and your includes break something if they are
used in assembly, then this can work out too

> +/* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 */

See Thomas doc patches, and Greg and Linus comments on these topics.

This is much leaner, is it?
Less legalese comment also means more code and a better, smaller
boilerplate lines/total lines ratio!
Thank you for your kind consideration.
