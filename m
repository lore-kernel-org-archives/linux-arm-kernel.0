In the GRUB case the kernel is loaded as an EFI application -- as far as I am
aware, GRUB for arm64 doesn't know anything about the Linux kernel Image
binary.

When loaded as an EFI application the EFI stub can perform the relocation,
which it already does if the kernel was laoded at an address it cannot execute
from. It looks like Ard's implemented that for v2.

Being (cold) booted from EFI is likely to be the most consistent case as we
have complete control over where the kernel is placed, bar some limitations
imposed by prior EFI applications or EFI itself.

Any links for this? I don't recall spotting this discussion.

Thanks,
Mark.
