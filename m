Just in case you haven't found them already, current version:

https://marc.info/?l=linux-arm-kernel&m=147708276818318&w=2

Original version:

https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/7980521/

The old one looks more readable and given that ptrace is not really a
fast path, I'm not two worried about run-time checks

I don't know whether it would work, we have incompatible siginfo_t on
AArch64/ILP32.
