To be honest I did not intend to implement any retry mechanism. I rather
intended to change the user-side which currently is not adapted to that
start-up. Typically with current QEMU code we have this 2 phase IRQ
signal startup, first set up eventfd signaling, then VFIO mask, then
turn irqfd on. With such sequence forwarding setup will fail because the
IRQ is seen as masked (false detection of activity).

Do you mandate such a retry mechanism? If forwarding fails we resort on
standard irqfd ...

I think forwarding setup should be as much static as possible (I think
this opinion also is shared by Marc?).

Please let me know your opinion on this.

Best Regards

Eric
