Yes, we are worried about memory update vs. IO update ordering here.
That was the reason why barrier() was introduced in this patch. I'll try to
clarify that better in the commit text.

That's my reasoning too. I'm trying to follow the x86 example here where there
is a compiler barrier in writeX() and readX() family of functions.
