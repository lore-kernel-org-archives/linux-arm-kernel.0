Thanks for the feedback.  I acknowledge that the documentation is not
quite clear for a userspace user. How about:

"To configure the physical address space size for a VM (IPA size) on arm64,
check KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_IPA_SIZE and use KVM_VM_TYPE_ARM_IPA_SIZE(IPA_Bits)
as the argument to KVM_CREATE_VM, where IPA_Bits is the maximum width of
any physical address used by the VM. The IPA_Bits is encoded in Bits[7-0]
of the machine type, and must be one of { 0, 32, ... , Host_IPA_Limit },
where :
1) IPA_Bits = 0 implies 40bits IPA (for backward compatibility)
2) Host_IPA_Limit is the maximum limit for IPA_Bits on the host, which is
    dependent on the CPU capability and the host kernel configuration.
    This can be detected by checking the extension KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_IPA_SIZE
"

note: I have renamed the KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_PHYS_SHIFT => KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_IPA_SIZE
above and can update the code, if the latter is better.
