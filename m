It may be worth noting in the commit message that we had to factor this
out of entry.S, or doing that as a preparatory patch.

Nit: s/supports/uses/ would be clearer.

I was going to suggest that we use the empty_zero_page, which we can
address with an adrp, because I had forgotten that we need to generate
the *physical* address.

It would be good if we could have a description of why we need the new
reserved page somewhere in the code. I'm sure I won't be the only one
tripped up by this.

It would be possible to use the existing empty_zero_page, if we're happy
to have a MOVZ; MOVK; MOVK; MOVK sequence that we patch at boot-time.
That could be faster than an MRS on some implementations.

We don't (yet) have infrastructure for that, though.

I don't follow what problem this actually protects us against. In the
case of preemption everything should be saved+restored transparently, or
things would go wrong as soon as we enable IRQs anyway.

Is this a hold-over from a percpu approach rather than the
current_thread_info() approach?

What am I missing?

I think that it's better to drop the ifdef and add:

	if (!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ARM64_TTBR0_PAN))
		return;

... at the start of each function. GCC should optimize the entire thing
away when not used, but we'll get compiler coverage regardless, and
therefore less breakage. All the symbols we required should exist
regardless.

How about something like:

	.macro alternative_endif_else_nop
	alternative_else
	.rept ((662b-661b) / 4)
	       nop
	.endr
	alternative_endif
	.endm

So for the above we could have:

	alternative_if_not ARM64_HAS_PAN
		save_and_disable_irq \tmp2
		uaccess_ttbr0_enable \tmp1
		restore_irq \tmp2
	alternative_endif_else_nop

I'll see about spinning a patch, or discovering why that happens to be
broken.

Surely RESERVED_TTBR0_SIZE, as elsewhere?

Thanks,
Mark.
