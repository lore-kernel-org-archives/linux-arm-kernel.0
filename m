Yeah, that I'm a fool.

This became weird becaus the first clause used to be "if (!is_uaccess ||
is_timer)", but now when the timer is interrupt driven (the timer
optimization series), we don't have that concept anymore, and I just
blindly removes the "|| is_timer" part.

I reworked this so that the functions now have

	if (is_uaccess)
		return;
