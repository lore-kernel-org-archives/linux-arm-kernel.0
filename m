It's probably less of an issue for arm64 because we don't take alignment
faults from the kernel and I think the perf case would resolve itself by
throttling the event. However, I also don't see the advantage of doing
this in the work loop as opposed to leaving it until we're actually doing
the return to userspace.

I looked to see what you've done for x86, but it looks like you check/clear
the flag before the work pending loop (exit_to_usermode_loop), which
subsequently re-enables interrupts and exits when
EXIT_TO_USERMODE_LOOP_FLAGS are all clear. Since TIF_FSCHECK isn't included
in those flags, what stops it being set again by an irq and remaining set
for the return to userspace?
