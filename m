I think it will be, when we saturate the refcount to INT_MIN/2 and 
return from the exception, we should catch every operation next.

I agree with you. One thing we should care about is we should check the 
refcount against zero before sc or use 'CAS' to do it, and we should 
modify the procedure in refcount_exception_handler.
@Kees, should we implement the add-from-zero case ? What do you think?
