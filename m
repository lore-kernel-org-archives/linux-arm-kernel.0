No, these patches are self-contained. As long as we only deal with
shared devices, we don't need EOImode=1, as as we save/restore the
active state, and the only irqchip change required (the state accessors)
went in with the 4.1 merge window.

The EOImode=1 stuff is still on the cards, and this series contains the
basic infrastructure for that (the last patch in the series is there
only for that purpose).

Hope this helps,
