Subject: [PATCH v5 0/4] Fix issues with huge mapping in ioremap for ARM64
Message-ID: <1522157100-16879-1-git-send-email-cpandya@codeaurora.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series of patches are follow up work (and depends on)
Toshi Kani <toshi.kani@hpe.com>'s patches "fix memory leak/
panic in ioremap huge pages".

This series of patches are tested on 4.9 kernel with Cortex-A75
based SoC.

These patches can also go into '-stable' branch.

Chintan Pandya (4):
  ioremap: Update pgtable free interfaces with addr
  arm64: tlbflush: Introduce __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable
  arm64: Implement page table free interfaces
  Revert "arm64: Enforce BBM for huge IO/VMAP mappings"

>From V4->V5:
 - Add new API __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable(unsigned long addr)
   for kernel addresses

>From V3->V4:
 - Add header for 'addr' in x86 implementation
 - Re-order pmd/pud clear and table free
 - Avoid redundant TLB invalidatation in one perticular case

>From V2->V3:
 - Use the exisiting page table free interface to do arm64
   specific things

>From V1->V2:
 - Rebased my patches on top of "[PATCH v2 1/2] mm/vmalloc:
   Add interfaces to free unmapped page table"
 - Honored BBM for ARM64
