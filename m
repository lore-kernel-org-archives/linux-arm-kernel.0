Oh, I am one of those guys who read the documentation at the very end
;-) Sorry, my bad.

So the idea is to observe an order when restoring the registers? And
relying on the ITS being disabled upon creation, so that we can write to
those registers? Then restoring CTLR as the very last to get things going?

I think we need some special handling for CWRITER as well, but I just
see that we have some bug in our ITS emulation (processing commands
while the ITS being disabled and not triggering command processing upon
ITS enablement). Waiting for Marc's verdict on this.
I think the patch I came up with should fix this particular issue here.

But apart from that it should work, I think.

Cheers,
Andre.
