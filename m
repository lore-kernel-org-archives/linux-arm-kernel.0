OK so I would propose a 16b DeviceId and 16b eventid

bits:     | 63   ...  48  | 47 ... 4 | 3   ...   0 |
values:   |   DeviceID    | ITT_addr |    Size     |

I can use the size field as a validity indicator

So I would suggest encoding
16b DeviceId
16b eventid
16b collection ID
16b pINTID

bits:     | 63   ...  48  | 47 ... 32 | 31 ... 15 | 15  ...  0 |
values:   |   DeviceID    |   pINTID  |  EventId  |   ICID     |

a null pINTID would meen the ITE is invalid.

Does that make sense or should I instead reduce the number of bits
allocated to collections and keep the pINTID bit number larger?

Maybe I miss something here. Currently I restore the ITEs before the
pending tables. So considering all the ITEs I know which LPI are defined
and which pending bits need to be restored. Why would I need to use a
coarse map for?

I understand the CPU cannot write the pending tables in our back, spec
says behavior would be unpredictable, right?
