yes, I agree.

I think VDISR_EL2 should just be saved/restored in vcpu_put/load after
the optimization.

Yes, that's what I mean.

That's why we'd also save/restore it in vcpu_put/vcpu_load.

So, for VSESR, we'd save/restore it in put/load (conditionally on VSE
being set if we like), and we'd also set it from pend_guest_serror.

For VDISR, it's just saved/restored in put/load.
