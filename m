The "virtual platform device" is created before the real wifi device, so that it can pass the gpios to the driver, and power up the device before calling sdio_register_driver.
But as Franky said, this power sequence is only generally for 4329, not for the USB dongle chips. So it's not a good idea to add this "power up" in brcmfmac.

That seems reasonable to represent as a GPIO rather than a regulator since it connects directly into the WiFi device as a GPIO, and its use within the WiFi device can indeed be governed purely internally to the WiFi driver/HW. However, if this is some GPIO that controls the power to e.g.
>VBAT3V3_IN_WF, VDDIO_WF, or other power supply to the WiFi card, then it'd be better represented as a regulator, since the control point is outside the WiFi device.

I think Rakesh may can answer this.
