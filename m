I have no idea, but by the look of it, something could be doing DMA on
top of your guest page tables, which is not really expected. I suggest
you carefully look at:

1) the DMA addresses that are passed to your device
2) the page tables that are programmed into the SMMU
3) the resulting translation

Hopefully this will give you a clue about what is generating this.

Thanks,
