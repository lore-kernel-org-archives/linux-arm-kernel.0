The main benefit of doing the flush/restore of the pending tables at the
same place as where we handle the other tables is:

when doing the pending table restore, we have finished the restoration
of the collection & device tables; as such we know exactly which LPI
pending state needed to be restored.

Assuming we do that independently on ITS tables I guess we would need to
"blindly" restore the whole pending tables. The 1st kB can be used for
coarse mapping but well this is more complex and less efficient I think.
Does that make sense?

Well it is implemented as a Set/Get attribute and as a group in itself
to be homogeneous with regs. In userspace functions sometimes also are
called set/get for save/restore so I did not find it too much
far-fetched. Also Peter reviewed it and did not point it out. I would be
tempted to leave it as is, waiting for somebody else to complain but
well I don't have a strong opinion.

Thanks
