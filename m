Does that only leave the case of the vCPU being scheduled for the first
time? Or am I missing something else?

Practically speaking, we cannot. Emulating the feature would be so
detrimental to performance as to render the feature useless --  every
function prologue/epilogue in a guest would end up trapping to hyp.

Additionally, if the algorithm is IMP DEF, we simply don't know how to
emulate it.

Making this an opt-in makes sense to me, given it affects migration.
I'll take a look at what we do for SVE.

Whoops. Fixed.

Sure, done.

I think it's likely that some applications will use ptrauth while others
do not. Even if the gust OS supports ptrauth, KVM may repeatedly preempt
an application that doesn't use it, and we'd win in that case.

There are also some rarer cases, like kexec in a guest from a
ptrauth-aware kernel to a ptrauth-oblivious one.

I don't have strong feelings either way, and I have no data.

Thanks,
Mark.
