How are we going to make sure the userspace provided a valid devid then?
- we have this info at user struct level: kvm_irq_routing_msi
- we wouldn't propagate the info at kernel struct level:
kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry
- the only place where we could check the devid availability against the
need is at kvm_set_routing_entry I think (routing adaptation on ARM).

What is going to happen if devid == 0 since unset?

this refers to arch/x86/kvm/irq.h, arch/powerpc/kvm/irq.h, ...

This typically declares things we have in include/kvm/arm_vgic.h
like irqchip_in_kernel

So currently I don't see things we should put in that header.
