Subject: [PATCH v11 00/19] KVM: arm64: Optimise FPSIMD context switching
Message-ID: <1527181008-13549-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Note: Most of these patches are Arm-specific.  People not Cc'd on the
whole series can find it in the linux-arm-kernel archive [2].

Git: see [3]

This series aims to improve the way FPSIMD context is handled by KVM.
Changes since the previous v10 [1] are minor, but one patch has been
split.

** To Catalin Marinas, Alex Benn?e: **

I have retained your Reviewed-bys on patches 7 and 8: these were split
from patch 7 of v9.  Although the code is (almost) the same as noted
below, I advise you to take a look.

(all) reviewers please note:

 * Patches 7 and 8 have been split from the previous patch 7, since
   the update to INIT_THREAD_INFO is logically a fix and deserves
   a Fixes: tag.

   I have also moved the definition of INIT_THREAD_INFO to after the
   TIF_* definitions that it now depends on (mysteriously this wasn't
   causing a compile error anyway, but I've not dug into why).

 * Other changes are all additions or rewordings of comments, and
   amendments commit messages.

Cheers
