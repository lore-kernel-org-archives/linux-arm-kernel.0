OK, will address both the above comments.

You are right. It is a design decision.

Right, and it is "up to 1MB" and not always, depending on the IPA size.
And for 16K it would be up to 256K (e.g, with 40bit IPA).

Correct.

For e.g, we can perfectly run a guest with 40bit IPA under a host with 16K+36bit
VA. The moment we go above 40bit IPA, we could trigger the conditions above.
I think it is perfectly fine for the guest to choose higher IPA width, and place
its memory well above as long as the qemu/lkvm doesn't exhaust its VA. I just
tried booting a VM with memory at 0x70_0000_0000 on a 16K+36bitVA host and it
boots perfectly fine.

I am sorry, I didn't get your point about the PMD level.

Done.
