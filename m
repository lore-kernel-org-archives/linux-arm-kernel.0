We can't currently do that for 64k pages, since the segment alignment
is only 64k. But we should be able to patch that up I think

Yes, but the likelihood that an unrelated stray vmalloc access is
within 16 KB of a stack pointer that is close ot its limit is
extremely low, so we should be able to live with the risk of
misidentifying it.

Yes.
