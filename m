Subject: [PATCH v5 10/30] arm64/sve: Kconfig update and conditional
 compilation support
In-Reply-To: <1509465082-30427-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
References: <1509465082-30427-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
Message-ID: <1509465082-30427-11-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patch adds CONFIG_ARM64_SVE to control building of SVE support
into the kernel, and adds a stub predicate system_supports_sve() to
control conditional compilation and runtime SVE support.

system_supports_sve() just returns false for now: it will be
replaced with a non-trivial implementation in a later patch, once
SVE support is complete enough to be enabled safely.
