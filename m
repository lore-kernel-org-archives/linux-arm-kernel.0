After a bit of digging together with James, we found the guilty one.
The hyp-stub entry code uses lr (aka x30) as a scratch register to 
find out if we've made it here via a HVC instruction. This is an 
absolutely pointless test, because by definition HVC is the only way to 
get there.

I've ended up with the following patch:

I'll split that in convenient patches and repost the series.

Thanks,
