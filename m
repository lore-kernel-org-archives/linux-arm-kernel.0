I actually think they are conceptually quite different on a VHE vs.
non-VHE system.  On a non-VHE system, you really are talking about a
world-switch, because you're switching the entire world as seen from the
kernel mode (EL1) and up.  On a VHE-system, you're just running
something in a less privileged CPU mode, like a special user space, and
not really changing the world; part of the world as you know it (EL2,
your own mode) remains unaffected.

So this is just the way I tried to lay out the patches to make them easy
to follow and easy to bisect.  I may have failed somewhat for the
former, or at least I should have explained this more clearly in the
commit message.

If you look at switch.c after patch 35 you should observe that the VHE
version does significantly less work (very little work, in fact) than
the non-VHE function and is essentially a wrapper around the low-level
exception return code, with as much logic shared between the two
functions as possible.

Note that in my initial optimization attempts I did not pursue the
separate kvm_vcpu_run functions, but I wasn't able to achieve the same
level of performance improvements as I am with separate functions, and
my attempts to pin-point and measure that by instrumenting the code with
cycle counts along the paths only indicated that it was the cumulative
effect of having multiple conditionals and unnecessary function calls
that cause significant differences between the two approaches.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
