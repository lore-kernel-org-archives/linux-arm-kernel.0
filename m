Ah, this isn't necessarily a 'RAS notification' SError/SEI, it may be a
'vanilla', v8.0 SError.

You've given a guest access to a physical device (how?), the guest has done
something, which caused the device to respond with SError.

Do you have a specific use-case for this? What is the ESR? What kinds of CPER
records does firmware generate? (if any)


We have to be careful here as devices can still generate asynchronous-interrupts
using SError, these aren't contained by ESB barriers. For these we should fall
back to KVM's v8.0 SError behaviour. KVM can tell them apart as the APEI code
doesn't claim the SError as an SEI notification, and with the RAS extensions the
ESR has the 'IDS' bit set.

No, I was assuming this was a RAS notification SEI, (because your patch 1/3 of
touched the RAS cpu-features) being given to user space to handle.

Instead, can I ask how the host should handle this SError if it had accessed the
device itself?


I agree device pass-through is going to be a special case for KVM, but before
the host can deliver a device RAS error into the guest that was using the
device, it needs to fully understand what the error means:

The error may mean that the careful configuration that makes device-passthrough
safe no longer works, letting the guest continue to access the device may let it
damage another guest or the hyper visor.


We may need a way for the host RAS code to identify the driver responsible, to
handle the device error, or delegate it if that's appropriate.

This was my mistaken assumption that you were passing an APEI RAS SEI
notification to user space via a KVM specific API. This wouldn't work for
applications not using KVM, or notifications not using SEI.

Here I was asking what happens if the notification used NOTIFY_POLL or
NOTIFY_IRQ (instead of NOTIFY_SEI) in the GHES, but this isn't relevant as it
doesn't look like this is a APEI RAS notification.

Yes, we are certainly missing processing for the other record types.

I think the only errors that user-space can know more than the kernel are memory
errors. These are the only RAS errors we should expect user space to handle. All
the others fall into either 'corrected by the kernel' or 'fatal for userspace -
SIGKILL'.

No, its my observation based on the record types. Memory is the only thing an
application can change. Everything else belongs to the kernel.
For a corrupt page of anonymous memory, there is nothing the kernel can do, but
report the data lost. The application (e.g. web browser) may know what the
corrupt data was, and if/how it can retrieve it again. This isn't true of
Processor/Cache/TLB/PCIe errors, which cover the other CPER records.


Thanks,

James
