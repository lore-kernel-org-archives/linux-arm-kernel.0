Hi,
Just a ping on this.

I was wondering if the first patch in this series:

[PATCH V3 1/6] mm: Introduce a general RCU get_user_pages_fast.
http://marc.info/?l=linux-mm&m=140923713202355&w=2

could be merged into 3.18 via an mm tree, or if there are any issues
with the patch that I should fix?

Acks or flames from the mm maintainers would be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,
