There are two kinds of 'masterIDs' that we're talking about here: the
ones that turn up in the STP stream and the ones that are accessible to
trace-side software (sw_start/sw_end). So in this case we want to
reflect the fact that there is no correlation between the two, because
hardware assigns STP channels dynamically based on the states of the
trace/execution environment. And although the trace side software can do
very little with this information, it does make sense to provide it.

The sw_start==sw_end situation, on the other hand, is a side effect of
the above and, as I said in one of the previous threads, may not even be
the case, or at least I don't see why it has to. And when it is the
case, I don't see the point in handling it differently from
sw_start<sw_end situation.

Why does this need to be done in the core and why '1'? IOW,
sw_{start,end} come straight from the driver, this new 'mshared' comes
straight from the driver, why do we need the core to modify the former
based on the latter?

It's 7b3bb0e753 in Linus' tree, but I don't see the logical connection
in the statement above.
