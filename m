le.h provides:

	generic___set_le_bit
	generic___test_and_set_le_bit
	...

Your new patches provide:

	__set_le_bit
	__test_and_set_le_bit

Would it not be better to have le.h provide one set of these LE bitops
(called either generic___set_le_bit or __set_le_bit - which ever you
prefer), and then have everyone using those common names (including
minix-le.h and ext2-non-atomic.h) rather than adding a whole series of
new bitop macros to the current mess?

To put it another way, if we're providing a set of guaranteed-little-endian
bitops, I'd like to see ARM doing this:

#define __test_and_set_le_bit(nr,p) ...

#include <asm-generic/bitops/minix-le.h>
#include <asm-generic/bitops/ext2-non-atomic.h>

where ext2-non-atomic.h could just be:

#define ext2_set_bit(nr,addr) __test_and_set_le_bit((nr),(unsigned long *)(addr))

instead of defining its own minix and ext2 bitops as we do now:

#ifndef __ARMEB__
#define WORD_BITOFF_TO_LE(x)            ((x))
#else
#define WORD_BITOFF_TO_LE(x)            ((x) ^ 0x18)
#endif
#define ext2_set_bit(nr,p)                      \
                __test_and_set_bit(WORD_BITOFF_TO_LE(nr), (unsigned long *)(p))

vs the current 'generic' stuff:

ARM byteorder.h (roughly):
#ifdef __ARMEB__
#define __BIG_ENDIAN 4321
#else
#define __LITTLE_ENDIAN 1234
#endif

le.h:
#define BITOP_LE_SWIZZLE        ((BITS_PER_LONG-1) & ~0x7)
#if defined(__LITTLE_ENDIAN)
#define generic___test_and_set_le_bit(nr, addr) __test_and_set_bit(nr, addr)
#elif defined(__BIG_ENDIAN)
#define generic___test_and_set_le_bit(nr, addr) \
        __test_and_set_bit((nr) ^ BITOP_LE_SWIZZLE, (addr))
#endif

ext2-non-atomic.h:
#define ext2_set_bit(nr,addr)   \
        generic___test_and_set_le_bit((nr),(unsigned long *)(addr))

What I'm trying to say is please don't make the existing mess of bitops
any worse than it currently is.
