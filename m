Well, you only get there if we've established that your CPU is affected
(it has an entry matching its MIDR with the HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR
capability), and that entry points to enable_psci_bp_hardening. It is
not the firmware that decides whether we need hardening, but the kernel.
The firmware merely provides a facility to apply the hardening.

You cannot have your cake and eat it. If you don't want to workaround
the issue, you can disable the hardening. But asking for the same kernel
to do both depending on what the firmware reports doesn't make much
sense to me.

Thanks,
