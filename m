I know that it's very hard to grasp from an upstream maintainer
perspective, but keep in mind where the bulk of execution of kernel code
lies. The average life cycle of a "stable" Linux distribution's kernel
is a few years.

So far all regressions in the user space gic code have been found within
less than 1y of the respective code release. I'd say that counts for
quite a well used feature.

Also keep in mind that without the architected timer support (and/or
without qemu patches than enable user space timers) the user space gic
support is pretty unusable to most people, so you obviously get less
reports.
