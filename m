Subject: [PATCH v4 0/5] KVM: irqfd consumer based on IRQ bypass manager
Message-ID: <1438622444-25444-1-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series transforms irqfd into an IRQ bypass consumer and
introduce the infrastructure shared by Intel posted-interrupts
and ARM forwarded IRQ series.

The bypass manager gets compiled for x86 and arm/arm64 when
KVM is used. A new kvm_irqfd.h header is created to externalize
some irqfd declarations going to be used by architecture specific
code. A new CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQ_BYPASS option is introduced
to enable architecture specific IRQ manager hooks.

the series depends on the IRQ bypass manager:

History:

v3 -> v4:
- fix compilation for arm/arm64
- rearrange signoffs/history on some patch files

v2 -> v3 (Feng Wu):
- rebase on IRQ bypass manager [PATCH v2] virt: IRQ bypass manager:
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/16/810
- Correct some minor errors and typo
- Add something needed for posted-interrupts

v1 -> v2:
- isolate the bypass manager and irqfd consumer in this series
- take into account Paolo's comments and use container_of strategy and
  remove additional fields introduced in v1.
- create kvm_irqfd.h
- add unregistration in irqfd_shutdown

v1: originally part of [RFC 00/17] ARM IRQ forward control based on IRQ
    bypass manager (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/7/2/268)


Eric Auger (4):
  KVM: arm/arm64: select IRQ_BYPASS_MANAGER
  KVM: create kvm_irqfd.h
  KVM: introduce kvm_arch functions for IRQ bypass
  KVM: eventfd: add irq bypass consumer management

Feng Wu (1):
  KVM: x86: select IRQ_BYPASS_MANAGER
