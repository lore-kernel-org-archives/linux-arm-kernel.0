The way I integrated this seemed natural at the time, but your
reaction suggests that it may not be the right approach...


At its heart, I'm trying to abstract out the special behaviour of
all unallocated ID registers, so that we can decide at runtime which
ones to hide fro the guest: within the ID register block, each
unallocated register becomes RAZ, not UNDEFINED as would be the case
for other system registers, so we need to capture both behaviours.


If we want a generic handler for all the ID registers in sys_regs.c,
then we need a flag to tell us whether to pass the ID register through
from cpufeatures or to make it appear as zero.

For ZCR_EL1 on the other hand, we really want attempts to access that
to reflect an Undef to the guest if we are pretending that SVE is not
implemented.  Again if we want to filter out some sysregs in a runtime-
controlled way, we need a flag to tell us whether to filter out a
particular register.

So, we have two specific ways of rolling a feature that is really
implemented in the hardware back to the ARMv8-A behaviour (RAZ for ID
registers and Undef for anything else).

I tried to group these under a single concept of presence/absence,
which is what check_present() is intended to check.  However, we
don't really want ID registers to Undef when !check_present(): this
is bodged around with the additional SR_RAZ_IF_ABSENT flag so that
the decision about whether to make the register Undef or not can
be made generic.


It seems that this attempt at generalisation is creating more confusion
than it solves, so I may abandon it and just handle ID_AA64PFR0_EL1 and
ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 specially.

When/if we've done that a few times for different features, it may
become clearer what any generic framework for doing it should look
like...

Thoughts?
