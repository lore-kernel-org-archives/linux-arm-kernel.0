On ARM, stage 2 mappings that are more strict will supersede stage 1
mappings, so the idea is to use cached mappings exclusively for stage
1 so that the host is fully in control of the actual memory attributes
by setting the attributes at stage 2. This also makes sense because
the host will ultimately know better whether some range that the guest
thinks is a device is actually a device or just emulated (no stage 2
mapping), backed by host memory (such as the NOR flash read case) or
backed by a passthrough device.
