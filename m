Ah, of course.  I was only looking at the config options enabled in the
kernel I was building.  I've added INTEL_IDLE now and grep'ed the whole
kernel tree as well, finding a couple of extra possibilities:

I do see mwait used in the ACPI 4.0 Processor Aggregator Device driver, but
this seems sufficiently far removed from regular cpuidle that I don't
think it's appropriate to tag the power_saving_thread() function -
the initial commit talks about using the mechanism "to ride-out
transient electrical and thermal emergencies."

There's also the thermal "powerclamp" driver that enforces a particular
amount of idle time across the system.  For this one it's less clear to
me whether this is a valid "idle" state that we should ignore when doing
NMI backtracing.  This would be the clamp_thread() function in
drivers/thermal/intel_powerclamp.c.  For now I'm not including it,
but what do you think?

With the changes discussed so far in this email thread, we've gotten to:

ffffffff818df178 T __cpuidle_text_start
ffffffff818df180 T default_idle
ffffffff818df260 t mwait_idle
ffffffff818df3f0 T acpi_processor_ffh_cstate_enter
ffffffff818df4a0 T default_idle_call
ffffffff818df4e0 t cpu_idle_poll
ffffffff818df600 t intel_idle_freeze
ffffffff818df6a0 t intel_idle
ffffffff818df7b5 T __cpuidle_text_end

This is about 1,600 bytes (or about 450 instructions) that will cause
NMI to skip doing a backtrace if the PC is anywhere in the range.
