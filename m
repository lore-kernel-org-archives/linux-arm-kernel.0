This is a per-VCPU property. PMU interrupt could be PPI or SPI. For PPI
the interrupt numbers are same for each vcpu, while for SPI they are
different, so it needs to set them separately. I planned to support both
PPI and SPI. I think I should add support for SPI at this moment and let
users (QEMU) to set these interrupts for each one.
