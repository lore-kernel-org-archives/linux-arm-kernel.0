The first two overload existing architectural behavior, the third improves all
this with a third standard option. Its the standard story!

Yup, I was about to post a v4...

(heh, spinlock_t already contains a raw_spinlock_t)

The function pointer is a problem because SDEI is effectively two notification
methods. Critical can interrupt normal. I'd really like to keep the differences
buried in the SDEI driver.

v4 has a separate structure for the fixmap-entry and lock, which
ghes_copy_tofrom_phys() reaches into if in_nmi().

I thought this was for the polled driver, but that must be backed by an
interrupt too...

linux/timer.h has:
|  * An irqsafe timer is executed with IRQ disabled and it's safe to wait for
|  * the completion of the running instance from IRQ handlers, for example,
|  * by calling del_timer_sync().
|  *
|  * Note: The irq disabled callback execution is a special case for
|  * workqueue locking issues. It's not meant for executing random crap
|  * with interrupts disabled. Abuse is monitored!

This irq-disable behaviour is controlled by the flags field:
| #define TIMER_DEFERRABLE	0x00080000
| #define TIMER_IRQSAFE		0x00200000

and ghes_probe() does this:
| timer_setup(&ghes->timer, ghes_poll_func, TIMER_DEFERRABLE);

So I think the ghes_poll_func() can be called with IRQs unmasked, hence the
spin_lock_irqsave().

I thought this was safe because its just ghes_copy_tofrom_phys()s access to the
fixmap slots that needs mutual exclusion.

Polled and all the IRQ flavours are kept apart by the spin_lock_irqsave(), and
the NMIs have their own fixmap entry. (This is fine until there is more than
once source of NMI)


Thanks,
