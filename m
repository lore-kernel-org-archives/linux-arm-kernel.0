Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/10] arm64: implement support for KASLR
Message-ID: <1451301654-32019-1-git-send-email-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series implements KASLR for arm64, by building the kernel as a PIE
executable that can relocate itself at runtime, and moving it to a random
offset in the vmalloc area.

Notes:
- These patches apply on top of Mark Rutland's pagetable rework series:
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/462438
- The arm64 Image is uncompressed by default, and the Elf64_Rela format uses
  24 bytes per relocation entry. This results in considerable bloat (i.e., a
  couple of MBs worth of relocation data in an .init section). However, no
  build time postprocessing is required, we rely fully on the toolchain to
  produce the image (modulo some byte swapping in the Image header for BE
  kernels)
- We have to rely on the bootloader to supply some randomness in register x1
  upon kernel entry. Since we have no decompressor, it is simply not feasible
  to collect randomness in the head.S code path before mapping the kernel and
  enabling the MMU.
- The EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL that is invoked in patch #10 to supply randomness on
  UEFI systems is not universally available. A QEMU/KVM firmware image that
  implements a pseudo-random version is available here:
  http://people.linaro.org/~ard.biesheuvel/QEMU_EFI.fd.aarch64-rng.bz2
  (requires access to PMCCNTR_EL0 and support for AES instructions)
  See below for instructions how to run the pseudo-random version on real
  hardware.
- Only mildly tested. Help appreciated.

Patch #1 introduces KIMAGE_VADDR as the base of the kernel virtual region.

Patch #2 memblock_reserve()'s the .bss, swapper_pg_dir and idmap_pg_dir
individually.

Patch #3 rewrites early_fixmap_init() so it does not rely on the linear mapping
(i.e., the use of phys_to_virt() is avoided)

Patch #4 moves the kernel virtual mapping to the vmalloc area, along with the
module region which is kept right below it, as before.

Patch #5 adds support for PLTs in modules so that relative branches can be
resolved via a PLT if the target is out of range.

Patch #6 moves to the x86 version of the extable implementation so that it no
longer contains absolute addresses that require fixing up at relocation time,
but uses relative offsets instead.

Patch #7 reverts some changes to the Image header population code so we no
longer depend on the linker to populate the header fields. This is necessary
since the R_AARCH64_ABS relocations that are emitted for these fields are not
resolved at build time for PIE executables.

Patch #8 updates the code in head.S that needs to execute before relocation to
avoid the use of values that are subject to dynamic relocation. These values
will not be populated in PIE executables.

Patch #9 implements the core KASLR, by taking randomness supplied in register x1
and using it to move the kernel inside the vmalloc area.

Patch #10 adds an invocation of the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL to supply randomness to the
kernel proper.

EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL on real hardware
=================================

To test whether your UEFI implements the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL, download the
following executable and run it from the UEFI Shell:
http://people.linaro.org/~ard.biesheuvel/RngTest.efi

FS0:\> rngtest
UEFI RNG Protocol Testing :
----------------------------
 -- Locate UEFI RNG Protocol : [Fail - Status = Not Found]

If your UEFI does not implement the EFI_RNG_PROTOCOL, you can download and
install the pseudo-random version that uses the generic timer and PMCCNTR_EL0
values and permutes them using a couple of rounds of AES.
http://people.linaro.org/~ard.biesheuvel/RngDxe.efi

NOTE: not for production!! This is a quick and dirty hack to test the KASLR
code, and is not suitable for anything else.
