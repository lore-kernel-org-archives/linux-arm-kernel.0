Subject: [PATCH 0/9] Rework architected timer and fix UEFI reset
Message-ID: <1440942866-23802-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The architected timer integration with the vgic had some shortcomings in
that certain guests (one being UEFI) weren't fully supported.

In fixing this I also found that we are scheduling the hrtimer for the
virtual timer way too often, with a potential performance overhead.

This series tries to address these problems in proviging level-triggered
semantics for the arch timer and vgic intergration and seeks to clarify
the behavior when setting/clearing the active state on the physical
distributor.

Series based on kvmarm/next and also available at:
