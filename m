I think it's possible to avoid the layering violation that way too,
by loading the module based on the compatible string, with a module_alias.

static void vfio_platform_get_reset(struct vfio_platform_device *vdev,
                                    struct device *dev)
{
        const char *compat;
        int (*reset)(struct vfio_platform_device *);
        int ret, i;
	char modname[256];

        ret = device_property_read_string(dev, "compatible", &compat);
        if (ret)
                return;

	reset = vfio_platform_lookup_reset(compat);
	if (!reset) {
		snprintf(modname, "vfio-reset:%s", compat);
		request_module(modname);
		reset = vfio_platform_lookup_reset(compat);
	}

	vdev->reset = reset;
}

---

#define module_vfio_reset_handler(compat, reset)			\
MODULE_ALIAS("vfio_reset" compat);					\
static int reset ## _module_init(void)					\
{									\
	return vfio_reset_register(THIS_MODULE, compat, &reset);	\
}

I think that solution is good enough, as it avoids most of the
problems with the current implementation but is a simple enough change.
