For PMICs that provide power off, we've been adding a property to DT to
indicate whether the PMIC is *the* system power off controller or not.
If the property is present, the PMIC registers itself in the poweroff
hook. If not, it doesn't. So, there really isn't an algorithm for
selecting the power off mechanism, but rather we designate one mechanism
ahead of time, and that's the only one that's relevant. We could
probably do the same for reset mechanisms.

I guess the vexpress situation is actually the same; there's a single
concept of a custom vexpress reset, it's just that sysfs is used to
select exactly what that does?

Can't we avoid replacing handlers, but only registering a single handler?

OK, if there are architecture differences in how the hooks are
registered, that seems like a good thing to fix.
