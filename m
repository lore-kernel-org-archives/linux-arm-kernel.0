I don't know and I'd rather not guess on security issues. It's better
if someone else reviews the code.

Unless there is a very quick fix maybe this series should be removed or
reverted from linux-next? A diagnosis of "system calls can sometimes
hang on return" seems serious even for linux-next. Since it happens
very rarely in most setups I can easily imagine somebody spending a lot
of time digging at this.
