Good catch. It seems that some of the other compat platforms (x86,
sparc, powerpc) have the same thing. I guess the real solution would
be to introduce an asm-generic/compat.h file that contains a bunch
of those definitions, like

#ifndef compat_timespec
struct compat_timespec {
        compat_time_t   tv_sec;
        s32             tv_nsec;
};
#endif

#ifndef compat_timeval
struct compat_timeval {
        compat_time_t   tv_sec;
        s32             tv_usec;
};
#endif

#ifndef compat_sysctl
struct compat_sysctl {
        unsigned int    name;
        int             nlen;
        unsigned int    oldval;
        unsigned int    oldlenp;
        unsigned int    newval;
        unsigned int    newlen;
        unsigned int    __unused[4];
};
#endif

For the most part, arch/tile should have useful defaults, though not in the
case of struct statfs, because its 32 bit version does not have a statfs syscall
(it only has statfs64).
