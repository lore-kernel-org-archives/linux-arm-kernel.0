Does the architecture actually say that anywhere?

This could obviously be dangerous if broken systems actually exist.
Marc may know more about that than me.  An alternative would be to
modify the ACPI code to assume max(8 KB, page size) instead, and/or a
command line parameter to override this check.

That said, I'm not directly opposed to this patch, but I'll let Marc
have a look as well.
