I may say about my needs in it: to not lose all the existing
information in application.
Imagine you're restoring a container with 64-bit and 32-bit
applications (in compatible mode). So you need somehow
switch vdso type in restorer for a 32-bit application.
Yes, you may exec() and then - all already restored application
properties will got lost. You will need to transpher information
about mappings, make protocol between restorer binary
and main criu application, finally you'll end up with some
really much more difficult architecture than it is now.
And it'll be slower.

Also it's pretty logical: if one can switch between modes,
why can't he change vdso mapping to mode he got to?
(note: if the work about removing thread compatible flags
will be done (on x86), there will not even be such a thing,
as application mode - just difference on which syscalls it
uses: compatible or native).
