Yes, I will.

ARM uses lazy D-cache flushing as per cachetlb.txt. However, this file
recommends that the meaning of PG_arch_1 is 'dirty' and the bit is set
by flush_dcache_page(). It works fine if all PIO drivers would call
flush_dcache_page() but there are many (the majority?) that don't and we
end up with data corruption in user space. So rather than changing all
the drivers or proposing a PIO API (tried this as well :)), we changed
the meaning of PG_arch_1 to 'clean'. That's already done by PowerPC and
IA-64.

This was discussed on linux-arch on several occasions and I also posted
a patch to change the recommendations in cachetlb.txt
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cross-arch/6187).

OK. So in this case a PIO driver using sg_miter should still call
flush_dcache_page() as usual (or not at all as we change the meaning
PG_arch_1 for the architectures where this matters).

Thanks.
