So if I get this right, you want to insert an arbitrary random value
without an extra register in bits [(VA_BITS-1):first_random_bit] and
BIT(VA_BITS-1) is always set in the input because it's a kernel address.

Then you rotate so that the random bits become the LSBs and the random
value should be inserted into bits [NR_RAND_BITS-1:0] in x0 ?

So you do this via two rounds, first the lower 12 bits

> 	add x0, x0, #(random >> 12), lsl #12

Then the upper 12 bits (permitting a maximum of 24 randomized bits)

> 	ror x0, x0, #(63 - first_random_bit)

And then you rotate things back into their place.

Only, I don't understand why this isn't then (64 - first_random_bit) ?

This now sort of serves as the documentation if you don't have the
commit message, so I think you should annotate each line like the commit
message does.

Alternative, since you're duplicating a bunch of code which will be
replaced at runtime anyway, you could make all of these "and %0, %0, #1"
and then copy the documentation assembly code as a comment to
compute_instruction() and put a comment reference here.

It would be nice to have a comment on these, something like:

/* The LSB of the random hyp VA tag or 0 if no randomization is used. */

/* The random hyp VA tag value with the region bit, if hyp randomization is used */

tag_val should already be 0, right?

and wouldn't it be slightly nicer to have a temporary variable and only
set tag_lsb when needed, called something like linear_bits ?

Since you have two masks below this comment is a bit hard to parse, how
about explaining what makes up a Hyp address from a kernel linear
address instead, something like:

		/*
		 * We do have some free bits to insert a random tag.
		 * Hyp VAs are now created from kernel linear map VAs
		 * using the following formula (with V == VA_BITS):
		 *
		 *  63 ... V |   V-1  | V-2 ... tag_lsb | tag_lsb - 1 ... 0
		 *  -------------------------------------------------------
		 * | 0000000 | region |    random tag   |  kern linear VA  |
		 */

(assuming I got this vaguely correct).

> +		u64 mask = GENMASK_ULL(VA_BITS - 2, tag_lsb);

for consistency it would be nicer to use GENMASK_ULL(VA_BITS - 2, 0)
above as suggested in the other patch then.  And we could also call this
tag_mask to be super explicit.

> +
> +		va_mask = BIT(tag_lsb) - 1;

and here, GENMASK_ULL(tag_lsb - 1, 0).

> +		tag_val  = get_random_long() & mask;
> +		tag_val |= region;

it's actually unclear to me why you need the region bit included in
tag_val?

Ah, you do use 64 - first_rand in the code.  Well, I approve of this
line of code then.

Still sounds strange to me, just drop the comment I think if we keep the
BUG_ON.

Is this actually required for this patch or are we just trying to be
nice?

I'm actually not sure I remember what this is about beyond the VA=idmap
for everything on 32-bit case; I thought we chose the hyp address space
exactly so that it wouldn't overlap with the idmap?
