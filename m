Here's what I get on TI Keystone 2, which doesn't set the IBE bit for
any CPU:

CPU: Testing write buffer coherency: ok
CPU0: Spectre v2: firmware did not set auxiliary control register IBE bit, system vulnerable
CPU0: Spectre v2: using ICIALLU workaround
/cpus/cpu at 0 missing clock-frequency property
/cpus/cpu at 1 missing clock-frequency property
/cpus/cpu at 2 missing clock-frequency property
/cpus/cpu at 3 missing clock-frequency property
CPU0: thread -1, cpu 0, socket 0, mpidr 80000000
Setting up static identity map for 0x80008300 - 0x80008438
Hierarchical SRCU implementation.
smp: Bringing up secondary CPUs ...
CPU1: thread -1, cpu 1, socket 0, mpidr 80000001
CPU1: Spectre v2: firmware did not set auxiliary control register IBE bit, system vulnerable
CPU1: Spectre v2: using ICIALLU workaround
CPU2: thread -1, cpu 2, socket 0, mpidr 80000002
CPU2: Spectre v2: firmware did not set auxiliary control register IBE bit, system vulnerable
CPU2: Spectre v2: using ICIALLU workaround
CPU3: thread -1, cpu 3, socket 0, mpidr 80000003
CPU3: Spectre v2: firmware did not set auxiliary control register IBE bit, system vulnerable
CPU3: Spectre v2: using ICIALLU workaround

It should be noted that, if we implement a "bugs" bit exported to
userspace (as I think someone requested) that booting on a system
where only the boot CPU initially comes up (which has the IBE bit
set) and then bringing the secondary CPUs online after userspace
has started (where those CPUs don't have the IBE bit set) will
result in the system initially not being vulnerable, but then
becoming vulnerable when running on those other CPUs.

If the bugs bit had already been checked by userspace, then it would
think that there's no system level vulnerability.  Userspace would
need to check the status each time a CPU comes online.
