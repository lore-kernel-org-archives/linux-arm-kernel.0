??? If we only have word accesses, then we don't need to care about byte
accesses? Or do I got something wrong here?

Yeah, in fact GICR_TYPER and GICD_IROUTER are the only users remaining
afterwards. So I moved the declaration into vgic-mmio-v3.c and renamed
it to extract_words() on the way.
Will send the patch in a minute ...
