Sorry, I missed a crucial bit of information here.

For context: here's the remainder of my argument.  This is not a
recommendation...


--8<--

We can inhibit softirqs from trashing the FPSIMD regs by setting the
per-cpu kernel_neon_busy flag: that's forces softirq code to use
non-NEON fallback code without actually disabling softirq.

I'd come up with a local hack

 * kernel_neon_grab();

	to set the flag, which would happen in vcpu_load().

 * kernel_neon_ungrab();

	to clear the flag, which would happen as above and in
	vcpu_put().

It would be up to the caller to ensure that preemption cannot occur
between those calls (satisfied by use of a preempt notifier here), and
to save the host context when needed.

This would bound the kernel-mode NEON blackout to the time KVM spends
in the host kernel only: the above conditional relinquishing of the
FPSIMD regs ensures that a softirq trigger event occuring during the
(unbounded) guest execution time _does_ get to use NEON.

Agreed!

Since I will be hacking at this area as part of the SVE KVM support
anyway, I will sooner or later end up working on it -- at that point it
will likely be worth unifying the two mechanisms, at least for the VHE
case (SVE architecturally required v8.2, so VHE can be assumed in that
case).

It would be interesting to know what the numbers look like without
the FPSIMD optimisation.
