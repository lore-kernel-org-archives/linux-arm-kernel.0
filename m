Subject: [PATCH v6 0/6] Driver for at91 usart in spi mode
Message-ID: <20180607110020.20565-1-radu.pirea@microchip.com>

Hello,

This is the second version of driver. I added a mfd driver which by
default probes atmel_serial driver and if in dt is specified to probe
the spi driver, then the spi-at91-usart driver will be probed. The
compatible for atmel_serial is now the compatible for at91-usart mfd
driver and compatilbe for atmel_serial driver was changed in order to
keep the bindings for serial as they are.

Changes in v1:
- added spi-at91-usart driver

Changes in v2:
- added at91-usart mfd driver
- modified spi-at91-usart driver to work as mfd driver child
- modified atmel_serial driver to work as mfd driver child

Changes in v3:
- fixed spi slaves probing

Changes in v4:
- modified the spi driver to use cs gpio support form spi subsystem
- fixed dma transfers for serial driver
- squashed binding for spi and serial and moved them to mfd/atmel-usart.txt

Changes in v5:
- fixed usage of stdout-path property with atmel_serial driver

Changes in v6:
- removed unused compatible strings from serial and spi drivers
