Hmm, I wasn't aware you were also working on it.
The good news is that we are not alone on this task :).
I do it on my spare time, so any contribution is more than welcome.

The GPIO support is already part of the pinctrl patch.
The missing thing is the GPIO interrupt feature, but I am working on it.

Maybe you could focus on the clock support, as I see its support is
well advanced in you tree?
I see one bug in it, the timer clocks should be 90MHz, but your patch
indicates 45MHz.

I see you have started the LCD controller driver, maybe that is
another task you could handle?

Regarding USB, have you made it to work?

Kind regards,
Maxime
