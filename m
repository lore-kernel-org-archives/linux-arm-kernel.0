I meant "spurious" in the sense that they shouldn't get fixed by
changing the code near the warning.

I can't help but wonder what value the bug_table really has in the
absence of BUGVERBOSE though.  But in any case, not something this patch
should change.

"make tinyconfig" in the standard kernel tree.  It turns on a few
options that make the kernel even smaller.

"patched" here represents allnoconfig with your patch added, but with
CONFIG_BUG still turned off?

Doesn't seem too bad.  Rather large, but I think we ought to fix the
problem by 1) reducing the number of uses of BUG_ON in the kernel, and
2) compiling out more bits of the kernel entirely, including their calls
to BUG_ON.  Eliminating a class of warnings that cause people grief when
trying to build and contribute to tiny kernels seems worth it, at least
for now.

Looking at the thread, I think you have it at this point.

And personally I value simplicity of the patched code over simplicity of
the patch. :)
