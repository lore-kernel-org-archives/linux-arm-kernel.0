Indeed, as mentioned before I have it in a wrapper function with a
static variable.

There are two flavours of capabilities: global and per-VM ones,
depending on which fd you are issuing the ioctl. The per-VM ones are
just not very widely used yet (I only found PowerPC doing so).

That's why I do a per-VM capability check and I do it as late as
possible to let the GIC initialize first (hence the wrapper function).

As said before I don't like the idea of inferring the validity of a flag
by some hard-coded dependencies like "GICv3 on ARM64". I guess ARM(32)
will get GICv3 support sooner or later (I think I saw patches to do so
already). So as soon as a kernel supports it, we automatically get the
support from userland without changing a single line there. Also what
tells you that no other architecture or IRQ controller will ever need a
device ID? I just don't want to end up with something like:
(GICV3 && ARM64) || (GICV3 && ARM && KERNEL>4.4) || (SuperIRQC && i986)
or
(ARM || ARM64) && HAS_IRQ_ROUTING

Instead: If the kernel needs it, it tells you. Full stop.

To be honest it's me to blame here to not having introduced the
capability earlier. At the moment ARM has a different code path for
KVM_SIGNAL_MSI, which does not bail out if the flag field is set. With
Eric's patches this changes and we use the irqchip.c generic code, which
returns -EINVAL atm. So I plan to introduce this capability already with
the ITS emulation series, so we can just pick it up in the IRQ routing
series.
So we now have already two users of this, if that makes more sense.

Cheers,
Andre.
