I'm a bit worried about this change, although I can't put my finger on
exactly the problematic scenario. My concern is that if we have a system
where the host kernel is entered at NS-EL1 (because, e.g. EL2 is used for
something else or the bootloader just didn't load us there) then the booting
protocol doesn't mandate a zero-initialised CNTVOFF value. If we can
subsequently end up using the physical counter in the kernel and the virtual
counter in userspace, the vDSO will get confused because the datapage values
will not correspond to the values it actually ends up reading. There's also
the likelihood that existing EL2 init code simply isn't setting up
CNTHCTL_EL2 and CNTVOFF correctly, so we probably need a way to force
virtual counter on the cmdline.

In practice it looks like we always end up with ARCH_TIMER_VIRT_PPI out of
arch_timer_select_ppi, but that's not guaranteed and I haven't thought at
all about the 32-bit case, which has other quirks/complexities.
