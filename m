ILP32 tasks has unique context that is not like aarch64 or aarch32,
so we have to have unique ptrace handler. I prepared the patch for
ptrace with runtime ABI detection, as Catalin said, see there:
https://github.com/norov/linux/commit/1f66dc22a4450b192e83458f2c3cc0e79f53e670

If it's OK, I'd like to update submission.
