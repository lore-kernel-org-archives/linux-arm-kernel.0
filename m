I take it you mean the *guest* hangs? Because it doesn't get a timer
interrupt?

Your host kernel is something recent, I guess?

Mmh, that shouldn't happen with (v)GICv3. Do you use QEMU (which
version?) or some other userland tool?

This is not the right fix, not only because it basically reverts the
GICv3 part of 87322099052 (KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Signal IRQs using
their configured group).

Can you try to work out why kvm_vgic_vcpu_init() is apparently called
before dist->vgic_model is set, also what value it has?
If I understand the code correctly, that shouldn't happen for a GICv3.

Cheers,
Andre.
