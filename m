I think that patch is our best bet currently, but to save ourselves pain
in future it would be *really* nice if GCC and clang could provide an
option line -fno-absolute-addressing that would implicitly disable any
feature that would generate an absolute address as jump tables do.

With v4.15 (and clang 5.0.0), I did not have to disable jump labels to
get a kernel booting on a Juno platform, though I did have to pass
-fno-jump-tables to the hyp code.

Which kernel version and clang version are you using?

Thanks,
Mark.
