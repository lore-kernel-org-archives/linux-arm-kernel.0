I don't think it's about caring, but we (I) didn't consider it when
designing that API.

Plenty of things are broken about the VGICv2 implementation and API, so
my goal is not to have GICv3 be similar to GICv2, but to design a good
API.

I don't agree; using the same API with slightly different semantics
depending on which device you created is much more error prone than
having a clear separation between the two different APIs, IMHO.

I'm not convinced that we should be compatible with GICv2 at all.  (The
deeper argument here is that GICv2 had an architectural limitation to 8
CPUs so all the CPU addressing is simple in that case.  This is a
fundamental evolution from GICv2 to GICv3 so it is only natural that
there are substantial changes in this area.)

I'll let Marc or Peter chime in if they disagree.

Cool!
