Sure, Unfortunatly I think it doesn't really increase your testing coverage.

I tested on a 2-node NUMA Cavium cn8890 (ThunderX).  This chassis is 
known as CRB-2S.  Running Ubuntu 16.04.2 userspace.

First I verified that a kernel built from clean v4.12-rc3 would fail 
with symptoms of no interrupts being processed while running a heavy KVM 
start/stop workload.  It does, we get a failure in under 5 minutes.

Then I applied your 25 patch set, and retested.  With the patch set 
applied, no failures were observed after more than 4 hours.
