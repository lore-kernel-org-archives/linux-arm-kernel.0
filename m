Subject: [ 004/184] clockevents: Dont allow dummy broadcast timers

2.6.32-longterm review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

From: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>

commit a7dc19b8652c862d5b7c4d2339bd3c428bd29c4a upstream.

Currently tick_check_broadcast_device doesn't reject clock_event_devices
with CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DUMMY, and may select them in preference to real
hardware if they have a higher rating value. In this situation, the
dummy timer is responsible for broadcasting to itself, and the core
clockevents code may attempt to call non-existent callbacks for
programming the dummy, eventually leading to a panic.

This patch makes tick_check_broadcast_device always reject dummy timers,
preventing this problem.
