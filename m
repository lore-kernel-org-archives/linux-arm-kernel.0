Consider the following three cases, assuming pending is clear in the
initial state:

Case 1:
	CPU A			CPU B
	-----			-----
	read pending
				lock irq
				set pending
				unlock irq

Case 2:
	CPU A			CPU B
	-----			-----
				lock irq
	read pending
				set pending
				unlock irq


Case 3:
	CPU A			CPU B
	-----			-----
				lock irq
				set pending
				unlock irq
	read pending


The only effect of adding a lock/unlock around the read_pending()
operation is to force case 2 to be equivalent to case 3, but case 1
could still happen, so this just boils down to observing the value
before or after the write, both of which are fine.

If there were weird side effect from reading this value, or even getting
to the struct would depend on other things CPU B could do while holding
the lock, it would be a different story, but here I'm faily certain you
don't need the lock.

Can you can find an example where something breaks without holding the
lock here?
