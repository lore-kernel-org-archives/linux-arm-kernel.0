I wouldn't dare!  Put that way, it seems very clear that it was always
at best a redundant test, which Nitin now shows can go wrong.  Okay,
thanks, let's forget about whether file invalidation can or cannot
also put a page into this state, and proceed with your fix.

The architectures which appear to need fixing in the same way are
arm, mips, parisc, sh and sparc64 (xtensa looks right already, and
score just looks confused - a whole function __update_cache() which
checks for PG_arch_1, yet nothing sets it?).
