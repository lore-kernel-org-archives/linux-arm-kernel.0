Subject: [PATCH 0/5] arm64: Add support of KVM with ACPI
Message-ID: <1454950049-741-1-git-send-email-julien.grall@arm.com>

Hello,

This small series allows an ARM64 ACPI based platform to use KVM.

Currently the KVM code has to parse the firmware table to get the necessary
information to setup the virtual timer and virtual GIC.

However the parsing of those tables are already done in the GIC and arch
timer drivers.

This patch series introduces different helpers to retrieve the information
from different drivers avoiding to duplicate the parsing code.

Note there is patch series ([1] and [2]) adding support of KVM on ACPI,
although the approach chosen is completely different. The code to parse
the firmware tables are duplicated which I think make more complex to
support new firmware tables.

Regards,
