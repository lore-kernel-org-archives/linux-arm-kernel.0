Can you elaborate?

It's not valid to do a function return from one thread to another.

Switching from per-process to per-thread keys would be an ABI break
unless it's opt-in.

Can the availability of XPAC* be determined from the feature regs, or
is that insufficient?

This is a little different from the keys, which the kernel must
provision / allow to be set in order for them to be useful.

I guess there's no ABI impact for adding these later, so maybe it's not
urgent if nobody shouts.

Not sure.  This is arguably not more gross than related things the
kernel already does, and may be inefficient for userspace to do e.g.,
when capturing perf backtraces.  Still gross though.

Side question: do you know whether there will be DWARF / ELF annotations
for this?  Since ptr auth is a compile-time option, it is plausible that
an attribute could be added to indicate that an image uses it.
