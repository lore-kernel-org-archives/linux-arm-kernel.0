Subject: [PATCH] kvm: arm/arm64: Fix emulated physical timer IRQ injection
Message-ID: <20180716172357.6121-1-andre.przywara@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

When KVM emulates a physical timer, we keep track of the interrupt
condition and try to inject an IRQ to the guest when needed.
This works if the timer expires when either the guest is running or KVM
does work on behalf of it, since it calls kvm_timer_update_state().
However when the guest's VCPU is not scheduled (for instance because
the guest issued a WFI instruction before), we miss injecting the interrupt
when the VCPU's state gets restored back in kvm_timer_vcpu_load().

Fix this by moving the interrupt injection check into the
phys_timer_emulate() function, so that all possible paths of execution
are covered.

This fixes the physical timer emulation, which broke when it got changed
in the 4.15 merge window.
The respective kvm-unit-test check has been posted already.
