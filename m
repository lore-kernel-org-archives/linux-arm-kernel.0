Let me try to explain that:

The two primitives work on different "objects". kern_hyp_va() works on
an address. If what you have is a pointer, then kern_hyp_va is your
friend. On the contrary, if what you have is a symbol instead of the
address of that object (and thus not something we obtain by reading a
variable), then hyp_symbol_addr is probably what you need.

Of course, a symbol can also be a variable, which makes things a bit
harder. The asm constraint are such as compilation will break if you try
to treat a local variable as a symbol (the 'S' constraint is defined as
"An absolute symbolic address or a label reference", and the '&s' makes
it pretty hard to fool).

I've tried to make it make it foolproof, but who knows... ;-)

Hope this helps,
