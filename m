No, I don't think so. The performance hit I am referring to is the
performance hit caused by leaving the trapping of VM system register
writes enabled all the time, so that writes to MAIR_EL1 are always
caught. This is why patch #1 implements some of the sysreg write
handling in EL2

OK, that answers my question then. The availability of a
write-allocate setting on write-through attributes suggested to me
that writes would go to both the cache and main memory, so that the
write-back cached attribute the host is using for the same memory
would not result in it reading stale data.

This was tested on APM, by Drew and Laszlo (thanks guys)

I have recently received a Seattle myself, but I haven't had time yet
to test these patches myself.
