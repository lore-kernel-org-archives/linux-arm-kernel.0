Yes, but you can identify the CPU by index, or by its MPIDR.
We had a discussion about which was the best way for doing
the VGIC API, and I can't remember which way round we ended up
going for. Whichever we chose, we should do the same thing here.

So is it a valid use case to create a PMU with the interrupt not wired
up to anything? (If it's never valid it would be nice to diagnose it
rather than just silently letting the guest run but not work right.)
