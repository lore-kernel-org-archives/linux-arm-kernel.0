Hi Christoffer,

Thanks for being patient enough to review the code :-) without much of
the comments. I now realise there needs much more documentation than
what I have put in already. I am taking care of this in the next
revision already.

AFAIT, no we don't check it anywhere. May be we should. We could plug this
into my CPU feature infrastructure[1] and let the is_hype_mode_available()
use the info to decide if we can support 40bit IPA ?

Right, I will document this in a comment.

Yes, the stage-2 entry is just supposed to show the entry level (2).

Correct, I have fixed it already.

Yes, will do it.

You are right. The rule is simple. Upto 16 tables can be concatenated at
the stage-2 entry level.

Because, we can concatenate upto 16 page table entries. With the current
set of page sizes the above 'magic' formula works out. But yes, the following
suggestion makes more sense.

OK, we could do that.

No, you right. I need to document all the above properly, which I is something
I am in the middle of.

I can send an updated version (which is in the test furnace) soon, so that
you can take a look ?
