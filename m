But why would it need the capability to create models? The idea is to
check the capability before the actual KVM_SIGNAL_MSI or
KVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING ioctl (and cache that result). I have a function
with a static variable to do that, so it looks like:

+  if (check_for_msi_devid(kvm)) {
+    irq_routing->entries[irq_routing->nr].flags = KVM_MSI_VALID_DEVID;
+    irq_routing->entries[irq_routing->nr].u.msi.devid = device_id;
+  }

Possibly, but it would be saner to tell userland that it's a per VM
decision for ARM. Since you need extra support bits in the userland
anyway (to set up GICv2M or ITS emulation), I think it is acceptable to
require a late, per-VM capability check in userland in that case.

Yeah, that is true to some degree.
But the idea is that the userland code that sets up GSI routing or
triggers MSIs via KVM_SIGNAL_MSI is architecture agnostic (or it could
be), so you don't want to introduce #ifdef ARM in there.
But for the rest of the code I agree there is no real need to
differentiate between requiring a device ID or not. Reworking Eric's and
my patches proved that - at least on the kernel side: propagating the
device ID unconditionally does not harm even if the value in there is
garbage. Also there is no real choice - either you require the device ID
(ITS emulation) or you ignore it (GICv2M and other archs).

Cheers,
Andre.
