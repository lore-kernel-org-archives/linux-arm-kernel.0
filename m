Hi Suzuki,

Thanks for having a look.

In general, I agree - it makes sense to avoid duplication.

Having said that, the helpers here allow following a common pattern for
handling the various page sizes - pte, pmd and pud - during stage 2
fault handling (see patch 4).

As you've said you're OK with this change, I'd prefer to keep this patch
but will drop it if any others reviewers are concerned about the
duplication as well.

Thanks,
Punit
