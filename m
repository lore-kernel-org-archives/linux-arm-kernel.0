If VESA and shmem are broken, they should either be fixed or removed.

If you fix them, then we could have separate virtual buses for virtio-pci
and emulated-pci (or whatever you want to call it). We could also have
a separate bus for passthrough-devices too.

However, that's quite a lot of work for a bug-fix, so I guess the easiest
thing is to extend your current hack to cover VESA and shmem too.
