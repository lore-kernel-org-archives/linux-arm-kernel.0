We do this for PTEs. I don't see this applicable to PMDs. Because,

1) To mark any PMD invalid, we need to be sure that next level page
    table (I mean all the 512 PTEs) should be zero. That requires us
    to scan entire last level page. A big perf hit !
2) We need to perform step 1 for every unmap as we never know which
    unmap will make last level page table empty.

Moreover, problem comes only when 4K mapping was followed by 2M
mapping. In all other cases, retaining valid PMD has obvious perf
gain. That's what walk-cache is supposed to be introduced for.

So, I think to touch only problematic case and fix it with TLB
invalidate.

I couldn't think of new problems with this approach. Could you share
any problematic scenarios ?

Also, my test-case runs fine with these patches for 10+ hours.

Sure, will get more from here.

Thanks for the review Mark.
