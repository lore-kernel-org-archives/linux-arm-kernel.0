You're right - I made a quick mental mapping between the arch/tile
_cpu_idle assembly and the arch/arm64 cpu_do_idle.  But on tile the
way it works is we can racelessly enable interrupts and then issue the
"nap" instruction; it is similar to WFI except that you actually take
the interrupt right from the nap instruction itself, and then have to
manually bump forward the PC in the handler if you want the nap to act
more like a WFI.  I see on closer examination that you're right, we
won't interrupt in the cpu_do_idle assembly anyway.

You're also right that there is no support for remote stack dump on
arm64 right now.  I added the arm64 "support" just because I am
hacking on arm64 most of the day at this point anyway, and felt like
the cpu_idle tracking knowledge might as well be there if/when support
for some kind of NMI-style remote interrupt was added to the Linux
implementation.

The Tile architecture also has no "NMI" per se, but we use individual
bitmasks to enable and disable interrupts, so the Linux irq_disable()
just amounts to "write a particular bitmask into the enable
register".  The bitmask itself is just a per-cpu variable that changes
as interrupt sources are configured, and there are a few (a couple of
performance interrupts, and a synthetic one used for cross-core ipi)
that we never mark as maskable.

I think this is all fair enough, and I will back out the arm64 "support" for my next
patch series.

The cpu idle tracking here is done solely to make the "backtrace all cpus" output
less crazy-verbose.  We annotate functions because claiming "there's nothing
interesting to see here; go away" is not something you want to do unless you're
really quite sure that there's nothing interesting going on there. In particular, if
the RCU stuff is screwed up, you want to see backtraces out of the RCU code if you
happen to be somehow stuck there, even if some RCU state claims you are idle.

See e.g. the discussion with Peter Ziljstra starting around here:
