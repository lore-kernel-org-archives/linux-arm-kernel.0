Subject: [PATCH 00/13] arm64: Virtualization Host Extension support
Message-ID: <1436372356-30410-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

ARMv8.1 comes with the "Virtualization Host Extension" (VHE for
short), which enables simpler support of Type-2 hypervisors.

This extension allows the kernel to directly run at EL2, and
significantly reduces the number of system registers shared between
host and guest, reducing the overhead of virtualization.

In order to have the same kernel binary running on all versions of the
architecture, this series makes heavy use of runtime code patching.

The first ten patches massage the KVM code to deal with VHE and enable
Linux to run at EL2.

The next patch catches an ugly case when VHE capable CPUs are paired
with some of their less capable siblings. This should never happen,
but hey...

The last two patches add an optimisation allowing a physical interrupt
to be serviced on the host without doing a full save/restore, leading
to potential reduction in interrupt latency.

This has been tested on the FVP_Base_SLV-V8-A model, and based on
v4.2-rc1. I've put a branch out on:
