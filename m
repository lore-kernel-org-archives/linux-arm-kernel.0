From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@linaro.org>

KVM/ARM differs from other architectures in having to maintain an
additional virtual address space from that of the host and the guest,
because we split the execution of KVM across both EL1 and EL2.

This results in a need to explicitly map data structures into EL2 (hyp)
which are accessed from the hyp code.  As we are about to be more clever
with our FPSIMD handling, which stores data on the task struct and uses
thread_info flags, we have to map the currently executing task struct
into the EL2 virtual address space.

However, we don't want to do this on every KVM_RUN, because it is a
fairly expensive operation to walk the page tables, and the common
execution mode is to map a single thread to a VCPU.  By introducing a
hook that architectures can select with HAVE_KVM_VCPU_RUN_PID_CHANGE, we
do not introduce overhead for other architectures, but have a simple way
to only map the data we need when required for arm64.

The use of hyp_current to pass the value of "current" to hyp is backed
out compared with Chritoffer's original patch.

Instead, I do most of the grubbing around in task_struct to the host
side to reduce the amount of stuff that needs to be duplicated in hyp.
