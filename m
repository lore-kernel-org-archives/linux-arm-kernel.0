Yeah, most of the documentation wouldn?t be enough to deduce the changes you need in user space applications, but I agree that that doesn?t mean we can?t improve going forward :).

There are defines for the individual event lines you can mask. I?ll clarify.

There are defines for that again, I?ll clarify :).

See above ;).

The counter is enabled, but the timer isn?t, as you can never receive an event. But yes, I agree that the wording isn?t explicit enough. I?ll see if I can come up with something better.

It basically enables the KVM_EXIT_ARM_TIMER capability - and I didn?t want to make the name too long. Any suggestions?

It can?t, because it doesn?t know :(. We can?t trap that event.

That?s what I want, but it?s not what hardware gives me. All I can do is poll whether it?s still up - and that?s basically what this interface does.
