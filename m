Both! Any case where the support is not uniform across all CPUs.

A CPU can implement address auth and/or generic auth, and either may use
an architected algorithm or an IMP DEF algorithm.

Even if all CPUs report an IMP DEF algorithm, the particular algorithm
may differ across CPUs.

I'll take a look.

I think this is the result of going searching for similar lazy context
switching, and stumbling on some (fairly different) code on x86.

It looks like I can use vcpu_load() instead, so I'll give that a shot
for v2.

Yes.

I guess it's not.

Initially, I was followed the same approach we take for fpsimd, leaving
the feature trapped until we take a shallow trap to hyp. Handing all the
sysreg traps in hyp was unwieldy, so I moved that down to the kernel
proper. That meant I couldn't enable the trap when switching from host
to guest, and doing so in the regular context switch seemed like the
next best option.

Something like that could make more sense. It should be fairly simple to
implement a decaying counter to determine when to trap.

I'd steered clear of optimising the lazy heuristic as I'm testing with
models, and I don't have numbers that would be representative of real
HW.

Today, only userspace uses pointer auth, and the kernel does not.
However, in-kernel usage is on the cards.

I'd avoided that so far, since it would be undone when in-kernel usage
is implemented. If you prefer, I can implement that for now.

We'll trap if the current CPU supports one of the two (with an
architected algorithm), but some other CPU does not (or uses an IMP DEF
algorithm). Note that we're checking that all CPUs have the feature.

It's there to cater for the case that some CPUs lack a feature that
others have, so that we expose a uniform view to guests.

There's a single control to trap both address/generic authentication, so
it has to check that support is uniform for both. 

I'd meant to fix this up to not be so pessimistic -- we could support
one without that other, so long as it is uniformly absent. e.g. if all
CPUs support address auth and all CPUs have no support for generic auth.

I'll need to add negative cpucaps to detect that. I'll try to sort that
out for v2.

Sorry; I'd meant to fix things up so that we could support one without
the other. Likewise for __ptrauth_restore_state().

I'll try to fix this up for v2.

Thanks,
Mark.
