I don't follow you here. sival_ptr is greater than 32-bit on a 64-bit
kernel.

That's a little endian architecture and the use of ptr_to_compat() looks
fine to me.

s390 uses si_int already, as in my proposed arm64 patch.

tile seems to be bi-endian, though I couldn't see a Kconfig option, nor
something defining __BIG_ENDIAN__ in headers or Makefile. I guess it's
coming from the compiler directly. Anyway, on big endian tile, I we have
the same issue as on big endian arm64.

paris, sparc and mips all use si_int instead of si_ptr, so that's fine.

Same for powerpc, it uses si_int instead of si_ptr.

I think it's only tile that needs fixing for big endian, something like
the arm64 patch below:
