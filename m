The issue in [0] arises when we try to unmap a page at stage2, while holding a
different spinlock and we try to do cond_resched_lock(), thinking we might
spend too much time holding the lock. With this patch, we don't try to relax
the lock if we are dealing with smaller sizes and hence avoids cond_resched_lock().
So in effect it tries to avoid the cond_resched_lock() when we could finish
the operation soon enough.

Hope that helps.
