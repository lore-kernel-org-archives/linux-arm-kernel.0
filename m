I saw the module for x86. arm64 works slightly differently since there
are multiple debugfs dumping sources, the init_mm and EFI page tables.
These are built in and can call register but then have no way to
actually register the debugfs entry when the module is inserted since
the current config covers both/all of the exporters. I
decided against trying to add the infrastructure to make modularity
work because I was spending more time on that than the actual W^X checks.

Thanks,
Laura
