Just to clarify: we can never remove interfaces that an older version of the
C library was using. What I'm asking is that we don't introduce any of the
unnecessary ones for architectures that don't already have them.

It looks like this implementation checks for each one of them to be present
first and then uses a fallback implementation if it does not exist. This would
clearly let us remove the handlers we don't want to support, but there
are two possible downsides:

- some other libc might be lacking that fallback path
- the fallback might be much slower, e.g. time() should fallback to
  the vdso version of clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE) for
  best performance, rather than the time() syscall or CLOCK_REALTIME.

So I'd argue that if an architecture already has a time() vdso implementation,
we probably want to keep that entry point but make it point to the best
generic implementation (i.e. clock_gettime CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE).
