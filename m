Yes, sorry.

I managed to confuse myself reading the same bit. It says (GICv3 spec):

"A hypervisor must only use the pending and active state for software
originated interrupts, which are typically associated with virtual
devices, or SGIs."

That's the PENDING+ACTIVE state, and not the pending and active bits
like I read it initially.

Now consider the following scenario:

- We inject a virtual edge interrupt
- We mark the corresponding physical interrupt as active.
- Queue interrupt in an LR
- Resume vcpu

Now, we inject another edge interrupt, the vcpu exits for whatever
reason, and the previously injected interrupt is still active.

The normal vGIC flow would be to mark the interrupt as ACTIVE+PENDING in
the LR, and resume the vcpu. But the above states that this is invalid
for HW generated interrupts.

The way the spec is written is slightly misleading. But the gist of it
is that we still signal the guest using the PENDING bit in the LR, and
switch the LR as usual. it is just that we can't use the PENDING+ACTIVE
state (apparently, this can lead to a double deactivation).

Not sure the above makes sense. Beer time, I suppose.
