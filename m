I don't understand the issue here. the vgic_irq->group field does not 
exist in 4.16 (neither in the first nor the last version). Nor does the 
line you are modifying.

Both exist in mainline, but what you are mentioning shouldn't be an 
issue in mainline since vgic_irq->group gets initialized in 
kvm_vgic_vcpu_init for SGIs and PPIs (i.e. intid < 32) which includes 
your interrupt.

Cheers,
