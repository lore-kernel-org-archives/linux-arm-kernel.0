Like most clock drivers, the Maxim 77686 PMIC clock binding
follows the convention that the "#clock-cells" property is
used to specify the number of cells in a clock provider.

But the binding document is not clear enough that it shall
be set to 1 since the PMIC support multiple clocks outputs.

Also, explain that the clocks identifiers are defined in a
header file that can be included by Device Tree source with
client nodes to avoid using magic numbers.

Finally, add "clock-output-names" as an optional property
since now is supported by the clock driver.

Changes since v5:
  - Add "clock-output-names" as an optional property now that is supported.

Changes since v4: None

Changes since v3:
 - Don't change clock-names property to make clear that it's
   the consumer clock name and should not match the producer clock.
   Suggested by Doug Anderson.
