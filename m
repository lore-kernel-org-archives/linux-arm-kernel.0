Right. It's probably not worth unless there is a significant overhead
in terms of code size or performance in the coherent linear case.

What about object code size? I guess since ixp23xx is the only platform
that announces itself as coherent, we probably don't need to worry about
it too much either. Lennert?

On everything else, we only replace a direct functin call with an
indirect one.

Ok, just pick one then if nobody has a strong opinion either way.

Ok, I see.
