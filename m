Assuming I got it right, yes. It currently makes the race Xie XiuQi spotted
worse, which I want to fix too. (details on the cover letter)

I'd like to pick these patches onto the end of that series, but first I want to
know what NOTIFY_SEI means for any OS. The ACPI spec doesn't say, and because
its asynchronous, route-able and mask-able, there are many more corners than
NOTFIY_SEA.

This thing is a notification using an emulated SError exception. (emulated
because physical-SError must be routed to EL3 for firmware-first, and
virtual-SError belongs to EL2).

Does your firmware emulate SError exactly as the TakeException() pseudo code in
the Arm-Arm?
Is the emulated SError routed following the routing rules for HCR_EL2.{AMO, TGE}?
What does your firmware do when it wants to emulate SError but its masked?
(e.g.1: The physical-SError interrupted EL2 and the SPSR shows EL2 had PSTATE.A
 set.
 e.g.2: The physical-SError interrupted EL2 but HCR_EL2 indicates the emulated
 SError should go to EL1. This effectively masks SError.)


Answers to these let us determine whether a bug is in the firmware or the
kernel. If firmware is expecting the OS to do something special, I'd like to
know about it from the beginning!

Sure. The phrase 'external modules' usually means the '.ko' files that live in
/lib/modules, nothing outside the kernel tree should be doing this stuff.


Thanks,
