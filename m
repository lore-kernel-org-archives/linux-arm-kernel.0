Subject: [PATCH v4 00/26] KVM/ARM: Add support for GICv4
Message-ID: <20171006153401.5481-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

This series implements full support for GICv4 in KVM, bringing direct
injection of MSIs to arm and arm64, assuming you have the right
hardware (which is quite unlikely).

To get an idea of the design, I'd recommend you start with commit
7954907bedaf as well as patch #26, which try to shed some light on the
approach that I've taken. And before that, please digest some of the
GICv3/GICv4 architecture documentation[1] (less than 800 pages!). Once
you feel reasonably insane, you'll be in the right mood to read the
code (no, I didn't bother changing the above, I already hit LWN/QotW
once).

Now that the low-level irqchip code has been merged, what we have here
is only the KVM-specific part. I've lifted two of Eric's patches
(having slightly changed one of them) as they form the base of this
series.

The stack has been *very lightly* tested on an arm64 model, with a PCI
virtio block device passed from the host to a guest (using kvmtool and
Jean-Philippe Brucker's excellent VFIO support patches[3]), as well as
on a Huawei D05 box using an Intel I350 Ethernet card and passing a VF
into the guest. So far, things are solid enough (although some HW need
workarounds that I'll address separately).

I've pushed out a branch based on 4.14-rc3 containing the dependencies:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maz/arm-platforms.git kvm-arm64/gicv4-kvm

* From v3:
   - Lots of cleanups following Christoffer's review
   - Got rid of all of the irqchip code (well, merged it)
   - Picked the minimal set of patches from Eric to get this working
   - Prevent VM save if using GICv4
   - Rebased on top of 4.14-rc3

* From v2:
  - Lots of fixes all over the map (the doorbell code was amazingly
    wrong, both at the GICv4 level and in KVM)
  - KVM GICv4 enablement is now gated by a command-line option and
    defaults to off
  - Now properly deals with ordering of vITS creation
  - Some debugging features
  - More documentation so that I can forget what this is all about
  - Huawei D05 quirks

* From v1:
  - The bulk of the 30-something initial patches have seen countless
    bugs being fixed, and some key data structures have been subtly
    tweaked (or killed altogether). They are still quite similar to
    what I had in v1 though.
  - The whole KVM code is brand new and as I said above, only lightly
    tested.
  - Collected a bunch a R-bs from Thomas and Eric (many thanks, guys).
