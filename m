If you read the note fully, you'll notice that there's a difference
between the async_tx API and the slave/cyclic DMA API (it's covered
in the first paragraph.)

Plus that documentation was written by me, reviewed by Dan and Vinod
and accepted.  You can treat it as authoritive, and take from it that
at_hdmac.c is buggy.
