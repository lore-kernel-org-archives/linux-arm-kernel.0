I think we should start up a new discussion on this. My understanding,
after a chat with Igor, who was involved in the untangling of vcpu-id and
apic-id for x86, is that using vcpu-id is preferred, unless of course
the device expects an apic-id/mpidr, in which case there's no reason to
translate it on both sides.

Other things to discuss are
1) Consistent use of the term vcpu-id vs. vcpu-index in the documentation.
   I just brought that up in my last reply to this patch.
2) Extending a vcpu-index [id] beyond 8-bits.
3) Should vcpu-ids be reusable after hotunplugging them?
4) Devices like this pmu and the vgic have some global (all vcpus wide)
   properties, but then also vcpu specific registers, which require the
   vcpu-index parameter. Should we instead create a "vcpu device ioctl"
   for these? I.e. extend SET/GET_DEVICE_ATTR to also be of type
   'vcpu ioctl', allowing the vcpu-index parameter to be dropped?

Thanks,
