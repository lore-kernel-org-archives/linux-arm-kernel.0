Subject: [PATCH v4 00/12] KVM Guest Debug support for arm64

Hi,

Here is V4 of the KVM Guest Debug support for arm64.

The changes are all due to Christoffer's review of v3 and sees a few
tweaks. The main change to the debug register code means we no longer
overlay the registers in sys_reg[] context but have specific areas for
the vcpu_debug_state and external_debug_state. As a result the need to
__u64 align the registers has been removed and we now have:

#define KVM_ARM_MAX_DBG_REGS 16
struct kvm_guest_debug_arch {
        __u32 dbg_bcr[KVM_ARM_MAX_DBG_REGS];
        __u64 dbg_bvr[KVM_ARM_MAX_DBG_REGS];
        __u32 dbg_wcr[KVM_ARM_MAX_DBG_REGS];
        __u64 dbg_wvr[KVM_ARM_MAX_DBG_REGS];
};

There are additional comments to clarify how we handle trapping and
preserving registers.

For full details see the changelog on each of the patches.

GIT Repos:

The patches for this series are based off v4.1-rc3 and can be found
at:

https://git.linaro.org/people/alex.bennee/linux.git
branch: guest-debug/4.1-rc3-v4

I'm still in the process of going through the QEMU comments and adding
the re-injection support. However the current working state can be
seen at:

https://github.com/stsquad/qemu
branch: kvm/guest-debug-v4
