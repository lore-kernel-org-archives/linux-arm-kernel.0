Hmmm.  How often is this expected to happen and what is the expected
extra cost of doing the early-exit handling in the C code vs. here?

I think we'd be better off if we only had a single early-exit path (and
we should move the FP/SIMD trap to that path as well), but if there's a
measurable benefit of having this logic in assembly as opposed to in the
C code, then I'm ok with this as well.

The code in this patch looks fine otherwise.

Thanks,
