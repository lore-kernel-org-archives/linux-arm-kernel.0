Hi Alexander,

Sorry for the slow reply, been caught up in an office move.

Looks good to me FWIW.  Just a couple of minor things:

It's probably not going to matter in practice, but it might be worth
emphasising in the comments that this leafness is only approximate.
It will sometimes be a false positive, because we could still
end up creating calls to libgcc functions from non-call statements
(or for target-specific reasons).  It can also be a false negative,
since call statements can be to built-in or internal functions that
end up being open-coded.

This might be too late, since it happens e.g. after addresses have
been calculated for branch ranges, and after machine-specific passes
(e.g. bundling on ia64).

The stack size is final after reload, so inserting the pass after that
might be better.

Thanks,
Richard
