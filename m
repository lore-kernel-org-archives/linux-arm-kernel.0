It sounds like we have two equally valid possible solutions:
1) force_sig(SIGKILL, current);
2) Allocate a new FPE_xxx code in asm-generic/siginfo.h
   I believe the next available number is 15.

If no one is going to notice this should be comparatively easy to fix.
I just don't have the knowledge of arm to make the judgement myself.
