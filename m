I define this below, so I don't think this is hugely important.  If you
think it clarifies things, I can fix it.

The priorities limiation must go out.  Not sure why we need to document
the lack of Group0 support on the user api?  Isn't that a strictly
internal limitation, but unlrelated to getting/setting the userspace
state?
