No.

If the boot CPU does not support 16KB pages, in general there isn't much
we can do since the console printing is done after we enabled the MMU.
Even mapping the UART address requires fixmap support and the PAGE_SIZE
is hard-coded in the kernel image. The DT is also mapped at run-time.

While in theory it's possible to fall back to a 4KB page size just
enough to load the DT and figure out the early console, I suggest we
just live with the "looping address" clue.
