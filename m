That's exactly what Will was trying to avoid, by having KVM to compute
the size of the IPA space based on the registered memslots. We've now
established that it doesn't work, so what we need to define is:

- whether we need another ioctl(), or do we carry on piggy-backing on
the CPU type,
- assuming the latter, whether we can reduce the number of bits used in
the ioctl parameter by subtly encoding the IPA size.

Thanks,
