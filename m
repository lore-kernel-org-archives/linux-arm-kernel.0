I don't understand how you are going to notify the guest UEFI instance
of anything or run the guest UEFI instance without going through the
guest kernel.

AFAIU, the guest UEFI instance is just a blob of software running at EL1
together with the guest kernel, and you're notification mechanism from
QEMU to the VM is pretty much limited to injecting a virtual interrupt
(of some kind) which is initially handled by the guest kernel.

I think you need to explain the "pass the CPER table to the guest UEFI"
concept in terms of what really happens, step by step, and when you say
"then Guest UEFI place the CPER table to the guest OS memory", I'm
curious who is running what code on the hardware when doing that.
