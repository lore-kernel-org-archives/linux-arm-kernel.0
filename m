There would be (almost) no difference in behaviour - VHE is designed
for the kernel to be unchanged, and the only difference is the timer
interrupt as you noticed.

What is really tricky is to perform the downgrade, because you're
completely changing the way the code is executed *while running it*.
This is not just about changing the memory map, but also changing the
effect of most system registers.

Stage-1 and EL2 are two vastly unrelated concept. The main issue is
that it is likely that your SMMU knows about VHE as well (it listens to
EL2-VHE DVM messages), and need to be reconfigured as well. Good luck
with that.

Yes, that's the plan.

Thanks,
