In order to track the PRI and ID bits written by guest,
VGIC needs to store these values when ICC_CTRL_EL1 is updated.
However,  QEMU is reseting VGIC by writing 0's to all the
registers after VGIC initialization and hence the back up values are
always reset to 0 and hence when guest read back, VGIC returns wrong value.

One option is to drop VGIC reset from QEMU which is not doing much.
