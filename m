I think this is still somewhat confusing. In particular, you're
describing both the "ask the kernel what it supports" API and
the "tell the kernel what we want" API in a single sentence
("...check KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_IPA_SIZE and use KVM_VM_TYPE_ARM_IPA_SIZE...").
There isn't a length limit on documentation, so why not describe
them both clearly in separate sentences?

Also, can I use any IPA value between 32 and Host_IPA_Limit, or
are only certain values in that range supported (if so, which)?

I think the new name is definitely clearer, thanks.
