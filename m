Subject: [PULL 00/79] KVM/ARM Changes for v4.12
Message-ID: <20170423170929.27334-1-cdall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here are the changes for KVM/ARM for v4.12 so far.  I may send another
pull request next week with the ITS save/restore patches if we feel they
are ready.  The ABI part of the ITS save/restore patches has matured for
a while so we just need to make sure on the implementation bits.

Note that this pull request shares a common base branch with the arm64
tree which has already been pulled by the arm64 folks into their
for-next/core branch.

As for these changes, they include:
 - Using the common sysreg definitions between KVM and arm64
 - Improved hyp-stub implementation with support for kexec and kdump on the 32-bit side
 - Proper PMU exception handling
 - Performance improvements of our GIC handling
 - Support for irqchip in userspace with in-kernel arch-timers and PMU support
 - A fix for a race condition in our PSCI code


The following changes since commit 97da3854c526d3a6ee05c849c96e48d21527606c:

  Linux 4.11-rc3 (2017-03-19 19:09:39 -0700)
