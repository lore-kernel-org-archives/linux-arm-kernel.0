I don't think we thought it through very carefully but just considered
FPEXC32_EL2 as part of the VFP state, but as you say, that doesn't
really make sense.

I was just objecting to the statement that this is a bring-over from the
32-bit side, which confused me, and I don't think that's true.

No, we just didn't look at it that carefully back then.

"Christoffer was being stupid..." ;)  It was just the way
it was, I don't think there was a good rationale, but I don't think it
helps to understand the change to provide guesswork either, so just
remove it.

That's another good point, should be able to do that.

That was definitely my conclusion as well.

Sure, I'll look at the next version as well if you send a new version.


Thanks,
