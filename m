What is the point of having #defines if their name doesn't indicate what
they do? You might as well call it BOB, or leave the raw value... And
no, don't do any of that. Just add the required defines.

The main problem is that they don't make any sense, as this is not a
sparse space. A stupid GIC driver may use it and actively waste memory
(and performance on a real HW implementation).

Page size is the ITS page size, nothing to do with the CPU at all. So
there is absolutely no requirement to support a particular page size
(you just need to support one).

> So I will clear bits 15:12 if the page size is 64K. Does that make sense?

Don't bother with the "if". Stick to 64kB pages.

Reset values are usually "UNKNOWN".

Please do.
