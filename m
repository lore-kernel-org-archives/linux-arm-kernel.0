Ah, yes, I'd managed to forget about the address hole, but I think that 
only makes it a bit trickier, rather than totally safe - it feels like 
you just need to chain one or two returns through "valid" targets until 
you can hit an epilogue with a "mov sp, x29" (at first glance there are 
a fair few of those in my vmlinux), after which we're back to the bit 55 
scheme alone giving no protection against retargeting the stack to a 
valid TTBR0 address.

True; in theory there are 3072 possible unaligned offsets to choose 
from, but compile-time randomisation doesn't seem much use, and 
hotpatching just about every function call in the kernel isn't a nice 
thought either.

Robin.
