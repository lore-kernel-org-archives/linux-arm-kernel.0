On x86, there's no check for inc/add-from-zero. Double-free would be:

- refcount_dec_and_test() to 0, free
- refcount_inc() to 1,
- refcount_dec_and_test() to 0, free again

Compared to the atomic_t implementation, this risk is unchanged. Also
this case is an "over decrement" which we can't actually protect
against. If the refcount_inc() above happens that means something is
still tracking the object (but it's already been freed, so the
use-after-free has already happened).

x86 refcount_dec() to zero is checked, but this is mainly to find bad
counting in "over decrement" cases, when the code pattern around the
object is using unchecked refcount_dec() instead of
refcount_dec_and_test(). (Frankly, I'd like to see refcount_dec()
entirely removed from the refcount API...)

On overflow, though, no, since we haven't yet reached all the way
around to zero (i.e. it's caught before we can get all the way through
the negative space back through zero to 1 and have a
refcount_dec_and_test() trigger a free).

If I could find a fast way to do the precheck for zero on x86, though,
I'd like to have it, just to be extra-sure.
