Right. This actually comes from 6abdd491698a ("ARM: mm: use
inner-shareable barriers for TLB and user cache operations"), and the
ARMv7 ARM doesn't mention any of this.

My take is that we want to be consistent. Given that KVM/ARM on 32bit is
basically ARMv7 only, I'd rather keep the ST version of the barrier
here, and change it everywhere if/when someone decides to support a
32bit kernel on ARMv8 (yes, we already do as a guest, but it doesn't
seem to really matter so far).

Thoughts?
