Hi Alex,

The subject of this change has a typo, and I also think it's not about
exposing the pause state (that's just an internal name/concept), but
about exposing the PSCI state, or simply the VCPU power state.

Nit: I would not taint the git log with this change but instead just
introduce a paragraph below starting with "On arm/arm64, " and you would
get the same effect.

As suggested on the QEMU series, HALTED is probably not the right thing
to use.

same as above

Are we capturing the vcpu features in some way or do we expect userspace
to migrate these on its own?  The reason I'm asking, is if you create
multiple VCPUs, where all the non-primary VCPUs are started in power off
mode, and then you boot your guest which powers on all VCPUs, and then
you restart your guest (with PSCI RESET), the system will not power on
all the non-primary VCPUs but hold them in power-off.

We need to make sure this behavior is preserved for a reboot across a
migration.  Is it?

Thanks,
