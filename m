Subject: [PATCH v3 10/20] KVM: arm/arm64: Move timer/vgic flush/sync under
 disabled irq
In-Reply-To: <20170923004207.22356-1-cdall@linaro.org>
References: <20170923004207.22356-1-cdall@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <20170923004207.22356-11-cdall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

As we are about to play tricks with the timer to be more lazy in saving
and restoring state, we need to move the timer sync and flush functions
under a disabled irq section and since we have to flush the vgic state
after the timer and PMU state, we do the whole flush/sync sequence with
disabled irqs.

The only downside is a slightly longer delay before being able to
process hardware interrupts and run softirqs.
