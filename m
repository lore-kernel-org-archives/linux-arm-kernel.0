OK, digging into the binutils source code, it turns out that indeed,
ABSnn relocations where nn equals the ELFnn memory size are treated
differently, but only if they have default visibility. This is simply
a result of the fact the code path is shared between shared libraries
and PIE executables, since PIE executable are fully linked. It also
means that we can simply work around it by emitting the linker symbols
as hidden.
