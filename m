Hi Marc,
   some ballpark numbers.

   hackbench about 30% of the time optimized path is taken
(for 10*40 test).

Lmbench3 upwards of 50% for context switching, memory bw,
pipe, proc creation, sys call. There are lot more tests
but I limited to these tests. In addition other processes
are running in background NTP, SSH, ... doing their own
thing.

I added a tmp counter to kvm_vcpu_arch to count vfpsimd
events.
