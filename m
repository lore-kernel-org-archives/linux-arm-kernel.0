> This is not for the ARM Processor Error Section, that is what the arm_event is handling. What you are adding this trace support for here is called the ARM Processor Error Information (UEFI 2.6 spec section N.2.4.4.1). So I think your trace event here should be called arm_err_info_event. This will also be consistent with the other two trace events that I'm planning on adding:

OK, I see. Thanks for your explanation.
