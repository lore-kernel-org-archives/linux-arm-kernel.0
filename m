Subject: [PATCH v3 00/19] KVM/arm64: Randomise EL2 mappings
Message-ID: <20171218173926.16911-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Whilst KVM benefits from the kernel randomisation via KASLR, there is
no additional randomisation when the kernel is running at EL1, as we
directly use a fixed offset from the linear mapping. This is not
necessarily a problem, but we could do a bit better by independently
randomizing the HYP placement.

This series proposes to randomise the offset by inserting a few random
bits between the MSB of the RAM linear mapping and the top of the HYP
VA (VA_BITS - 2). That's not a lot of random bits (on my Mustang, I
get 13 bits), but that's better than nothing.

In order to achieve this, we need to be able to patch dynamic values
in the kernel text. This results in a bunch of changes to the
alternative framework, the insn library, and a few more hacks in KVM
itself (we get a new way to map the GIC at EL2). This series used to
depend on a number of cleanups in asm-offsets, which is not the case
anymore. I'm still including them as I think they are still pretty
useful.

This has been tested on the FVP model, Seattle (both 39 and 48bit VA),
Mustang and Thunder-X. I've also done a sanity check on 32bit (which
is only impacted by the HYP IO VA stuff).

Thanks,

	M.

* From v2:
  - Fixed a crapload of bugs in the immediate generation patch
    I now have a test harness for it, making sure it generates the
    same thing as GAS...
  - Fixed a bug in the asm-offsets.h exclusion patch
  - Reworked the alternative_cb code to be nicer and avoid generating
    pointless nops

* From v1:
  - Now works correctly with KASLR
  - Dropped the callback field from alt_instr, and reuse one of the
    existing fields to store an offset to the callback
  - Fix HYP teardown path (depends on fixes previously posted)
  - Dropped the VA offset macros
