I'm well aware of this instruction.  Thank you though.

The concern was that we haven't done this in the past.  I think that was
because the size of a _Bool is not well-defined and we really didn't
care about a couple of handful of bytes when talking about vcpu
structures.  Really.

A u8 should work though, but probably this will all be moot if I combine
the flags into a single field.

Patches are welcome.
