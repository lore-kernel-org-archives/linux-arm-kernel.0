This patch adds the core support for switching and managing the SVE
architectural state of user tasks.

Calls to the existing FPSIMD low-level save/restore functions are
factored out as new functions task_fpsimd_{save,load}(), since SVE
now dynamically may or may not need to be handled at these points
depending on the kernel configuration, hardware features discovered
at boot, and the runtime state of the task.  To make these
decisions as fast as possible, const cpucaps are used where
feasible, via the system_supports_sve() helper.

The SVE registers are only tracked for threads that have explicitly
used SVE, indicated by the new thread flag TIF_SVE.  Otherwise, the
FPSIMD view of the architectural state is stored in
thread.fpsimd_state as usual.

When in use, the SVE registers are not stored directly in
thread_struct due to their potentially large and variable size.
Because the task_struct slab allocator must be configured very
early during kernel boot, it is also tricky to configure it
correctly to match the maximum vector length provided by the
hardware, since this depends on examining secondary CPUs as well as
the primary.  Instead, a pointer sve_state in thread_struct points
to a dynamically allocated buffer containing the SVE register data,
and code is added to allocate, duplicate and free this buffer at
appropriate times.

TIF_SVE is set when taking an SVE access trap from userspace, if
suitable hardware support has been detected.  This enables SVE for
the thread: a subsequent return to userspace will disable the trap
accordingly.  If such a trap is taken without sufficient hardware
support, SIGILL is sent to the thread instead as if an undefined
instruction had been executed: this may happen if userspace tries
to use SVE in a system where not all CPUs support it for example.

The kernel may clear TIF_SVE and disable SVE for the thread
whenever an explicit syscall is made by userspace, though this is
considered an optimisation opportunity rather than a deterministic
guarantee: the kernel may not do this on every syscall, but it is
permitted to do so.  For backwards compatibility reasons and
conformance with the spirit of the base AArch64 procedure call
standard, the subset of the SVE register state that aliases the
FPSIMD registers is still preserved across a syscall even if this
happens.

TIF_SVE is also cleared, and SVE disabled, on exec: this is an
obvious slow path and a hint that we are running a new binary that
may not use SVE.

Code is added to sync data between thread.fpsimd_state and
thread.sve_state whenever enabling/disabling SVE, in a manner
consistent with the SVE architectural programmer's model.

Changes since v2
----------------

Changes requested by Catalin Marinas:

 * [bugfix] Enabled IRQs during SVE access traps

   There is no special reason why interrupts have to be disabled in
   do_sve_acc(), and the original intention was to enable them --
   I missed this while developing the series.

   This patch avoids IRQ blackout while allocating thread.sve_state and
   saving/restoring.

   This also protects us against kzalloc() sleeping, which was a bug
   here previously since this function was running in atomic context.
   Relying on GFP_ATOMIC here doen't seem justifiable.

   The code is currently suboptimal in the case where no context switch
   occurs, since it adds a store-reload roundtrip that is not strictly
   necessary.  However, avoiding this leads to violation of some
   assumptions which would require additional refactoring or code
   duplication to resolve, particularly regarding the setting of
   ZCR_EL1.LEN.

   For now, I prefer to have code that works initially, and let the
   dust settle for a bit.

   This may be refactored better later.

 * Added WARN_ON(in_softirq() && !irqs_disabled()) to
   task_fpsimd_{load,save}(), to flag up attempts to call these
   functions when softirqs could occur.  This is far from being
   everything we could check, but masking of softirqs is the most
   crucial requirement.

   This will guard against maintenance accidents that call these
   functions in inappropriate situations.

 * Provided an explicit helper
   fpsimd_preserve_current_state_discard_sve() to ensure that task
   vector state is stored to memory and unconditionally discard sve.
   This gets the parent task into the right state such that fork just
   requires a memcpy of thread_struct followed by NULLing dst->
   thread.sve_state.

   With this, fpsimd_dup_sve() has nothing to do any more, so this
   function has been deleted from the patch.

   task_fpsimd_save() is factored out with a backend
   __task_fpsimd_save(bool force_discard), which is used in the few
   places where it is appropriate.

   For now, this breaks fpsimd_preserve_current_state() for SVE tasks,
   but there is no way for SVE tasks to exist yet: so just WARN().
   This issue is resolved by "arm64/sve: Signal handling support".

Miscellaneous:

 * Added comments explaining the intent, purpose and basic constraints
   for fpsimd.c helpers.

 * Added comments explaining the role of TIF_SVE.

 * Added a WARN_ON() check in task_fpsimd_save to confirm that the
   VL currently configured in ZCR_EL1.LEN is correct for current.

   This was identified as a maintenance risk when working on enabling
   IRQs in do_sve_acc().

   The new logic flags and avoids potential buffer overruns on
   sve_state that could otherwise occur if the VL is wrong.  In this
   case, we simply skip the save.  The task state will be corrupted, but
   that's better than corrupting kernel memory.

   Since the task state is now wrong, it can't resume: just inject a
   SIGKILL instead.  We can't BUG(), since this problem may be detected
   in softirq context where BUG() panics the kernel -- so
   force_signal_inject() is called instead.  "bad mode" is a confusing
   thing to print for this, so force_signal_inject() is updated to print
   the more general "unknown or unrecoverable error" for such signals:
   there is no other call to force_signal_inject() with signal==SIGKILL
   today.
