How can the guest interrupt change? This is HW, as far as the guest is
concerned. An actual interrupt line. We don't reconfigure the HW live.

Like I said before, this *cannot* change.

I think you're confused.

- The guest irq (vlr.irq) is entirely made up, and has no connection
with reality. it is stable, and cannot change during the lifetime of the
guest (think of it as a HW irq line).

- The host hwirq (vlr.hwirq) is stable as well, for the same reason.

- The Linux IRQ cannot change because we've been given it by the kernel,
and that's what we use for *everything* as far as the kernel is
concerned. Its mapping to hwirq is stable as well because this is how we
talk to the HW.

- irq_find_mapping gives you the *reverse* mapping (from hwirq to Linux
irq), and for that to work, you need the domain on which you want to
apply the translation. This is only useful when actually taking the
interrupt (i.e. in an interrupt controller driver). I can't see how that
could make sense here.

The purpose of this mapping is to, given the guest irq (because that's
what we inject), what the other values are:
- hwirq: to provide GICH with the interrupt to deactivate
- Linux irq: to control the active state through the irqchip state API.

Hope it makes more sense to you now.

Thanks,
