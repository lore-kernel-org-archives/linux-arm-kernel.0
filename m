Yup - this is just a property of BPF (and a nice one :)

On seccomp_attach_filter this check fires:
  if (fprog->len == 0 || fprog->len > BPF_MAXINSNS)
    return -EINVAL;

As well as in sk_chk_filter:
  if (flen == 0 || flen > BPF_MAXINSNS)
    return -EINVAL;

And:
  /* last instruction must be a RET code */
  switch (filter[flen - 1].code) {
    case BPF_S_RET_K:
    case BPF_S_RET_A:
      return check_load_and_stores(filter, flen);
  }

cheers!
