Ah-ha, okay, that explains part of my struggle. :)

Does ppoll still get interrupted like poll to require a restart_syscall call?

Regardless, the primary problem is this (emphasis added):

>> +        * - native ARM does _not_ expose true syscall.
>> +        * - compat ARM on ARM64 _does_ expose true syscall.

When you ptrace or seccomp an arm32 binary under and arm32 kernel,
restart_syscall is invisible. When you ptrace or seccomp an arm32
binary under and arm64 kernel, suddenly it's visible. This means, for
example, seccomp filters will break under an arm64 kernel.

(And apologies if I'm not remembering pieces of this correctly, I
don't have access to arm64 hardware at the moment, which is why I'm
reaching out for some help on this... I'm trying to close out this old
thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/1/20/778 )
