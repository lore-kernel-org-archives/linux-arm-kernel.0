Subject: [PATCH v6] KVM: arm/arm64: Route vtimer events to user space
Message-ID: <1474628854-69945-1-git-send-email-agraf@suse.de>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

We have 2 modes for dealing with interrupts in the ARM world. We can either
handle them all using hardware acceleration through the vgic or we can emulate
a gic in user space and only drive CPU IRQ pins from there.

Unfortunately, when driving IRQs from user space, we never tell user space
about timer events that may result in interrupt line state changes, so we
lose out on timer events if we run with user space gic emulation.

This patch fixes that by exposing kvm's view of the vtimer irq line to user
space and giving it a chance to sync that when it changes.

With this patch I can successfully run edk2 and Linux with user space gic
emulation.

v1 -> v2:

  - Add back curly brace that got lost

v2 -> v3:

  - Split into patch set

v3 -> v4:

  - Improve documentation

v4 -> v5:

  - Rewrite to use pending state sync in sregs (marc)
  - Remove redundant checks of vgic_initialized()

v5 -> v6:

  - s/pending/asserted/
  - split kvm_timer_flush_hwstate function
  - remove user_timer_asserted
  - rename kernel_timer_asserted to timer_irq_level
  - exit only once per level change
  - qemu tree to try this out: https://github.com/agraf/qemu.git no-kvm-irqchip-for-v6

@@ -3928,3 +3928,30 @@ In order to use SynIC, it has to be activated by setting this
 capability via KVM_ENABLE_CAP ioctl on the vcpu fd. Note that this
 will disable the use of APIC hardware virtualization even if supported
 by the CPU, as it's incompatible with SynIC auto-EOI behavior.
+
+8.3 KVM_CAP_ARM_TIMER
+
+Architectures: arm, arm64
+This capability, if KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION indicates that it is available and no
+in-kernel interrupt controller is in use, means that that the kernel populates
+the vcpu's run->s.regs.timer_irq_level field with timers that are currently
+considered asserted by kvm.
+
+If active, kvm guarantees at least one exit happens after it detects an
+assertion change. This exit could either be a KVM_EXIT_INTR or any other exit
+event, like KVM_EXIT_MMIO. This way kvm gives user space a chance to update its
+own interrupt asserted status. This usually involves triggering an interrupt
+line on a user space emulated interrupt controller, so user space should always
+check the state of run->s.regs.timer_irq_level on every kvm exit.
+
+The field run->s.regs.timer_irq_level is available independent of
+run->kvm_valid_regs or run->kvm_dirty_regs bits. If no in-kernel interrupt
+controller is used and the capability exists, it will always be available and
+populated.
+
+Currently the following bits are defined for the timer_irq_level bitmap:
+
+    KVM_ARM_TIMER_VTIMER  -  virtual timer
+
+Future versions of kvm may implement additional timer events. These will get
+indicated by additional KVM_CAP extensions.
