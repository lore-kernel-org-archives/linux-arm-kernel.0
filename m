No, this only works for .S files, not .c, since gcc starts the output with
an explicit .arch setting that overrides the command line. I think this
was done intentionally to prevent such a hack from working, and have
more reliable checks on the validity of the assembler instruction in
inline asm statements (which we try to circumvent here).
