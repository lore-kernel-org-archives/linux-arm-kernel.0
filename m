yes, it is. I agree.

For this CAP API, I have made a patch in the new series patches.

why it can not set the ESR?
In the KVM, we can return a encoding fault info to userspace, then user space can
specify its own ESR for guest.
I already made a patch for it.

 For memory_failure_queue(), I think the big problem is it is in a process context, not error handling context.
there are two context. and the memory_failure_queue() is scheduled later than the error handling.

Before route to the target EL, software set the spsr_el3.A to 1, then "eret", the PSTATE.A will be to 1.

Note:
PSTATE.A is shared by different EL, in the hardware, it is one register, not many registers.
spsr_elx has more registers, such as spsr_el1, spsr_el2, spsr_el3.

sorry, it is typo issue, should check HCR_EL2.AMO

Regardless it was trapped from EL1 or EL2. they are all from lower exception level.
it should be not encoding, such as Instruction Abort from a lower Exception level.
For both EL1 or EL2, the EC is 0b100000

EC == 0b100000: Instruction Abort from a lower Exception level.
Of course, if need re-encode for some cases, will do it.

before jumping, it will set the SPSR_EL3.A to 1.

In fact, we do not want to return to the context which is interrupted in Hawei's platform.
we will kill the APP or VM, not return to the context that interrupted.

typo issue, should be HCR_EL2.AMO.

For EL3, the EL1 and EL0 are all low level, why the EC needs re-encoding?

No, before jump, it will also check the spsr_elx.M to determine jump to which level.

Do you mean spsr_el3.A =1 or PSTATE.A = 1?
we just jump to the corresponding vector entry, not care spsr_el3.A or PSTATE.A is set or not set.

yes, it should. above is typo issue.

yes, it should and we already done that.

For some errors, BIOS will firstly handle it,
and then return to the interrupted context, OS even does not know this error happen.
