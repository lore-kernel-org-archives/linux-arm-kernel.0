I think I was confused about your point.  I thought you were arguing
that CPTR_EL2.TFP==1 + FPEXC_EL2.EN==0, and running in AArch32 EL1+EL0,
and accessing VFP at EL0 would trap to EL2, when in fact it traps to
EL1.  But now I think you're arguing that EL2 is unaffected by
FPEXC32_EL2, and I agree with that.

However, given the above, I don't understand how we can let the guest be
in control of FPEXC, if we want to make sure we trap VFP accesses?

I'll comment on the other patch.

Thanks,
