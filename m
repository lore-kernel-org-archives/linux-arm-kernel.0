Sure; I agree these are separate properties (my robustness and
efficiency concerns fall with the latter).

I was going to reply saying that I didn't agree, but in writing up
examples, I mostly convinced myself that this is the right thing to do.
So I mostly agree!

This would mean we treat the first impossible-to-handle exception as
that fatal case, which is similar to x86's double-fault, triggered when
the HW can't stack the regs. All other cases are just arbitrary faults.

However, to provide that consistently, we'll need to perform this check
at every exception boundary, or some of those cases will result in a
recursive fault first.

So I think there are three choices:

1) In el1_sync, only check SP bounds, and live with the recursive
   faults.

2) in el1_sync, check there's room for the regs, and live with the
   recursive faults for overflow on other exceptions.

3) In all EL1 entry paths, check there's room for the regs.

I believe that determining whether the exception was caused by a stack
overflow is not something we can do robustly or efficiently.

You mentioned the x29 pseudo-sp case, and there are other cases where
the SP value is proxied:

	mov	x0, sp
	ldr	x0, [x0, x1]

Or unrelated accesses that hit the guard page:
	
	adrp	x0, some_vmalloc_object
	add	x0, x0, #:lo12:some_vmalloc_object
	mov	x1, #bogus_offset
	ldr	x0, [x0, x1]

As above, I think it's helpful to think of this as something closer to a
double-fault handler (i.e. aiming to catch when we can't take the
exception safely), rather than something that's trying to catch logical
stack overflows.

Thanks,
Mark.
