How about:

@fname: a symbol name that will be defined as a function returning a
function pointer whose type will match @orig and @alt
@orig: A pointer to the default function, as returned by @fname when
@cond doesn't hold
@alt: A pointer to the alternate function, as returned by @fname when
@cond holds
@cond: a CPU feature (as described in asm/cpufeature.h)

The main issue is that C doesn't give you any access to the branch
function itself, except for the asm-goto statements. It also makes it
very hard to preserve the return type. For your idea to work, we'd need
some support in the compiler itself. I'm sure that it is doable, just
not by me! ;-)

This is why I've ended up creating something that returns a function
*pointer*, because that's something that exists in the language (no new
concept). I simply made sure I could return it at minimal cost.
