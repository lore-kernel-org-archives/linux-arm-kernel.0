Hi Will, thanks for testing!

Ah yeah, making oprofile rely on CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS is too
strict. I hadn't noticed that armpmu_get_pmu_id() is wrapped in
CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENTS and had intended op->cpu_type to be NULL and so
we'd fallback to the timer mode.

This patch needs to be dropped entirely (though another patch should
conditionally include oprofile_perf.o based on CONFIG_HW_PERF_EVENT
like I had in my original series).
