Subject: [RESEND PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Stop injecting the MSI
 occurrence twice
Message-ID: <1486132790-20890-1-git-send-email-shankerd@codeaurora.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The IRQFD framework calls the architecture dependent function
twice if the corresponding GSI type is edge triggered. For ARM,
the function kvm_set_msi() is getting called twice whenever the
IRQFD receives the event signal. The rest of the code path is
trying to inject the MSI without any validation checks. No need
to call the function vgic_its_inject_msi() second time to avoid
an unnecessary overhead in IRQ queue logic. It also avoids the
possibility of VM seeing the MSI twice.

Simple fix, return -1 if the argument 'level' value is zero.
