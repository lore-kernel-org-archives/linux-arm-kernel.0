> This patch converts the mv643xx_eth driver to use the mvmdio MDIO bus driver
> instead of rolling its own implementation. As a result, all users of this
> mv643xx_eth driver are converted to register an "orion-mdio" platform_device.
> The mvmdio driver is also updated to support an interrupt line which reports
> SMI error/completion, and to allow traditionnal platform device registration
> instead of just device tree.

> David, I think it makes sense for you to merge all of this, since we do
> not want the architecture files to be desynchronized from the mv643xx_eth to
> avoid runtime breakage. The potential for merge conflicts should be very small.

Series applied to net-next, thanks Florian.
