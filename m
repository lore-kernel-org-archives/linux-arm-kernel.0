Subject: [PATCH v5 00/30] ARM Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)
Message-ID: <1509465082-30427-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series implements Linux kernel support for the ARM Scalable Vector
Extension (SVE). [1]  It supersedes the previous v3: see [3] for link
and full cover letter.

This is a minor update to v4, but does contain a couple of important
fixes.

As in previous postings, the last two patches (here 29-30) are still
RFC and not proposed for merging at this time.

The patches apply on
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git
for-next/core
d7b1d22d3821 ("arm64: uapi: Remove PSR_Q_BIT")

To reduce spam, some people may not been copied on the entire series.
For those who did not receive the whole series, it can be found in the
linux-arm-kernel archive. [2]

See the individual patches for details of changes.

For reviewer convenience, a git tree is available. [4]

Since there are some changes against already-reviewed patches, I've also
pushed an unsquashed fixes tree for people to take a look at if it
helps. [5]


Summary:

 * "regset: Add support for dynamically sized regsets" fixed to avoid
   x86 breakage;

 * one trival arm64 patch added to add asmlinkage annotations, and a
   corresponding minor change to the Core task context handling patch;

 * one new arm64 fix ("signal: Verify extra data is user-readable in
   sys_rt_sigreturn") to ensure that access_ok() checks are done for the
   whole extended signal frame, not just the base frame;

 * one minor fix to the SVE sigreturn code to return consistent
   intermediate error values (semantic correctness, non-functional
   change);

 * one minor change to call __copy_from_user() instead of
   copy_from_user() in a situation where there is already an access_ok()
   check;
