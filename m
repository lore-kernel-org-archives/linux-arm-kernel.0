(1)Below hcr_el2.TEA/TERR two field is introduced by armv8.2, RAS extension.

TEA, bit [37]
	Route synchronous External Abort exceptions to EL2. The possible values of this bit are:
	0 Do not route synchronous External Abort exceptions from Non-secure EL0 and EL1 to EL2.
	1 Route synchronous External Abort exceptions from Non-secure EL0 and EL1 to EL2, if not routed
	to EL3.
	This bit is RES0 if the RAS extension is not implemented.
TERR, bit [36]
	Trap Error record accesses. The possible values of this bit are:
	0 Do not trap accesses to error record registers from Non-secure EL1 to EL2.
	1 Accesses to the ER* registers from Non-secure EL1 generate a Trap exception to EL2.
	This bit is RES0 if the RAS extension is not implemented.

(2) when synchronous External Abort(SEA) OS happen SEA, it trap to EL3 firmware.
then the firmware needs to do by faking an exception entry to  hypervisor EL2; or
by faking an exception entry to EL1
so if the hcr_el2.TEA is set, firmware will eret to EL2; otherwise, eret to EL1.
hcr_el2.TEA is only set for the guest OS.
not set for the host OS.


(3) setting hcr_el2.HCR_TERR want to trap the EL1 error record access to EL2.
