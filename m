I thought we'd gone over this. There should be no RAS errors/notifications in
user space. Only the symptoms should be sent, using the SIGBUS_MCEERR_A{O,R} if
the kernel has handled as much as it can. This hides the actual mechanisms the
kernel and firmware used.

User-space should not have to know how to handle RAS errors directly. This is a
service the operating system provides for it. This abstraction means the smae
user-space code is portable between x86, arm64, powerpc etc.

What if the firmware uses another notification method? User space should expect
the kernel to hide things like this from it.

If the kernel has no information to interpret a notification, how is user space
supposed to know?

I understand you are trying to work around your 'memory corruption at an unknown
address'[0] problem, but if the kernel can't know where this corrupt memory is
it should really reboot. What stops this corrupt data being swapped to disk?

Killing 'the thing' that was running at the time is not sufficient because we
don't know that this 'got' all the users of the corrupt memory. KSM can merge
pages between guests. This is the difference between the error persisting
forever killing off all the VMs one by one, and the corrupt page being silently
re-read from disk clearing the error.

Thanks,
