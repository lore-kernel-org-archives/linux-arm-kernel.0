In the meantime it occurred to me that the current dependency could be
written as just
    !CPU_32v4 && !CPU_32v4T

That shouldn't change anything, neither for both ARM nor for ARM64.
(This is because exactly one of ARM and ARM64 will always be set.)
Anyhow, I'll see what you'll come up with.

I compiled for the x86_64 target! I used a hack, not sure where it's
documented, to build object files by bypassing most of the build
infrastructure:
     make drivers/coresight/coresight-stm.o

But, since in this case that doesn't handle <linux/coresight-stm.h>
correctly, I used an ever bigger hack:
    make EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DCONFIG_CORESIGHT_STM" drivers/coresight/coresight-stm.o

This only works as long as the code doesn't use stuff that can't
possibly be reached in x86_64 (eg, it doesn't use platform specific
headers). It's a quick and dirty way to test changes to files normally
not compiled for your target.
