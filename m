I think I'd rather have a separate field for the user-writable TLS,
predicated on #ifdef COMPAT. It also removes confusion between the two tls
registers, which are also present on arm64.

Can't this hunk be in the is_compat_thread(...) block slightly earlier
on in the function? In fact, we're reading tpidr_el0 for both the compat and
native cases, so really this all be unconditional.

Maybe we could have a macro thread_user_tls(thread) so that we could just
do thread_user_tls(current->thread) = tpidr;
