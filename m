What I understood from Mike's explanation is that basically nothing is
fixed from the software perspective (talking about Coresight STM). One
doesn't know the master id with which one's data will be tagged,
regardless of whether one is cpu-affine or not, because:

 * even per-core master IDs will be highly implementation dependent and
   therefore not knowable by the kernel and subsequently userspace,
 * master IDs may change based on other conditions (besides security
   states), so even if we knew per-core master IDs for sure, it wouldn't
   give us the complete picture.

So even though from the HW perspective master IDs may be "hardwired" to
hardware states, the hardware states themselves are dynamic, so from the
SW perspective these master IDs are not static or hardwired at all.

If the same mmio write done by software would always result in the exact
same master ID tagged to it, that would be more like "static" to me.
