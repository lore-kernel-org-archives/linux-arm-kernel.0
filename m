Oh dear, my draft folder again :-( Sorry for that!

Yes, because there is already a flag value and no other way to specify
this, in contrast to ...

Here we already have a type field with some users, so lets piggy-back on
this.

Both ioctl extensions are coupled with a per-VM capability to let
userland know that it needs to provide a device ID.

Using flags on its own (without an explicit capability) is what I
opposed against, not flags in general. After all, that's what they are
meant for, right? In case of KVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING it just seems awkward
to me to use a flag when a different type would do as well.

But after all, I don't have a strong opinion on that matter, so if
others prefer using a flag I am also fine with that.

Poka,
Andre.
