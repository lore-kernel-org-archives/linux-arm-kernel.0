On top of the comment I've already given on this patch:

You've completely ignored the GITS_BASERn registers. While they are not
strictly necessary for your emulation, we need them for save/restore. I
expect the next version of this patch to at least expose:
- Device table
- Collection table

Also, consider advertising the Indirect bit in the GITS_BASERn
describing the Device table, the guest will thank you for it (if the
support it).

Thanks,
