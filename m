Hi Christoffer

I have tried your newer level-mapped-v7 branch, but bug is still there.

There is no special load in both host and guest. The guest (kernel 4.14) 
is often hanging when booting

Maybe my previous patch is not perfect enough, thanks for your comments.

I digged it futher more, do you think below code logic is possibly 
problematic?


vtimer_save_state?????????? (vtimer->loaded = false, cntv_ctl is 0)

kvm_arch_timer_handler????????(read cntv_ctl and set vtimer->cnt_ctl = 0)

vtimer_restore_state ? ? ? ? ?? (write vtimer->cnt_ctl to cntv_ctl, then 
cntv_ctl will

 ??? ??? ??? ??? ?? ? ? be 0 forever)


If above analysis is reasonable, how about below patch? already tested 
in my arm64 server.

 ??????????????? vtimer->cnt_ctl = read_sysreg_el0(cntv_ctl);
 ??????????????? if (kvm_timer_irq_can_fire(vtimer))
 ??????????????????????? kvm_timer_update_irq(vcpu, true, vtimer);

Cheers,
