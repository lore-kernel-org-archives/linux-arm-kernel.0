OK. But somehow this means the userspace can setup forwarding between an
SPI and a vLPI, right?

Oh forget it

correct, sorry for the noise.

I was confused by LPI_PROP_GROUP1 which was not documented in the
comment. But looking more carefully in the spec it corresponds to [1] =
RES1.

No you don't. I was rather anticipating other (future) callers, for
instance other bypass functions which could mess with those fields.
