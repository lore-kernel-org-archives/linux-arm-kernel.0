Subject: [PATCH v8 00/16] kvmtool: arm: ITS emulation and GSI routing support
Message-ID: <20161104173203.21168-1-andre.przywara@arm.com>

Hi,

this series teaches kvmtool how to support KVM's ITS emulation. Also
(as this is somewhat related and has been co-developed) it enables GSI
routing for ARM/ARM64, which allows IRQFDs to be used, for instance
to use vhost_net. At the moment this is dependent on the guest
using the ITS emulation, but GICv2M support may be added at a later time.

The first six patches are generic fixes and refactoring to pave the
road for the rest of the patches. Most importantly patch 3/16 pulls
the GSI routing code from x86 into generic code.
The following six patches add ITS emulation support. They reserve and
register the required ITS register frame and populate a DT node with
the necessary data. Also the patches add the device ID to the
KVM_SIGNAL_MSI ioctl.
Patches 13 and 14 enable IRQ GSI routing for ARM/ARM64.
This is needed to use IRQFDs, which is a prerequisite for vhost
functionality, for instance. The code sets up the (dummy) SPI
routing table and adds the device ID to the routing entry.
The last two patches enables the guest ITS support by extending the
existing --irqchip= parameter to allow "--irqchip=gicv3-its", both
for ARM64 and ARM (kernel support for this is still pending).

These patches make use of the recently (4.8-rc) merged KVM kernel
functionality, both Eric's IRQ routing series and the ITS emulation.
It can also be found in my kvmtool git repository [1].

Compared to v7 of the series this is mostly bugfixing and updates,
also adds the 32-bit support provided by Vladimir.

Cheers,
Andre.
