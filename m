Can't you rely on the asm-offsets.c mechanism before the plugin is used?

Most certainly head-inflate-data.c... who knows if someone will use an 
XIP kernel on an SMP system someday.

You should at least define those values in a header file that gets 
included by both this code and the plugin source. But asm-offsets.c 
would be best.
