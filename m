So I spent some time looking at this and I'm not 100% clear
if there would actually be much benefit to re-writing with
get_stack_info. Most of that design seems to come from x86
needing to handle multiple unwind options which arm64 doesn't
need to worry about. Any rework ended up with roughly
the same code without any notable benefit that I could see.
It's possible I'm missing what kind of cleanup you're suggesting
but I think just going with a tweaked version of on_accessible_stack
would be fine.

Thanks,
Laura
