I've probably taken a shortcut here - bear with me while I'm trying to
explain the issue.

For HW interrupts, we shouldn't even try to use the state bits in the
LR, because that state is contained in the physical distributor. Setting
the HW bit really means "there is something going on at the distributor
level, just go there".

If we were to inject a ACTIVE+PENDING interrupt at the LR level, we'd
basically loose the second interrupt because that state is simply not
considered.

So the trick we're using is to only inject the active interrupt, and
prevent anything else from being injected until we can confirm that the
active state has been cleared at the physical level.

Does it make any sense?
