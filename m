Sure. I'll fix this in v6.

Point ! Without the invalidation, free'ing a page is not safe. Better, I
do __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable() every time. This might not be as costly
as flush_tlb_kernel_range().

Now that I will call __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable() for every  PMD, I can
use __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable() here as well.

Previously, the thought was, while invalidating PUD by VA would not work
always because PUD may have next level of valid mapping still present in
the table (valid next PMD but invalid next-to-next PTE). In this case
doing just __flush_tlb_kernel_pgtable() for PUD might not be enough. We
need to invalidate subsequent tables as well which I was skipping for 
optimization. So, I used flush_tlb_kernel_range().

I will upload v6.
