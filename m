Hi James,
  sorry for the late response.

Ok.

I agree with you the KVM should not test this bit, because it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED classification.
from this patch history, it is made by Marc. do know whether it has some special reason to make this patch.

    arm/arm64: KVM: Inject virtual abort when guest exits on external abort

    If we spot a data abort bearing the ESR_EL2.EA bit set, we know that
    this is an external abort, and that should be punished by the injection
    of an abort.

 yes, they are two different bits

OK.

  for the armv8.0 CPU which does not have RAS feature, also use the EA bit, so may not directly use it separate whether external aborts should be handled first by
  firmware

  what do you want Linux to test? to test the type of error? check the {I,D}FSC should be OK.

  sure, it is no problem.
