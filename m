Subject: [PATCH v8 00/20] KVM: ARM64: Add guest PMU support
Message-ID: <1450771695-11948-1-git-send-email-zhaoshenglong@huawei.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

From: Shannon Zhao <shannon.zhao@linaro.org>

This patchset adds guest PMU support for KVM on ARM64. It takes
trap-and-emulate approach. When guest wants to monitor one event, it
will be trapped by KVM and KVM will call perf_event API to create a perf
event and call relevant perf_event APIs to get the count value of event.

Use perf to test this patchset in guest. When using "perf list", it
shows the list of the hardware events and hardware cache events perf
supports. Then use "perf stat -e EVENT" to monitor some event. For
example, use "perf stat -e cycles" to count cpu cycles and
"perf stat -e cache-misses" to count cache misses.

Below are the outputs of "perf stat -r 5 sleep 5" when running in host
and guest.

Have a cycle counter read test like below in guest and host:

static void test(void)
{
	unsigned long count, count1, count2;
	count1 = read_cycles();
	count++;
	count2 = read_cycles();
}

Host:
count1: 3049567104
count2: 3049567247
delta: 143

Guest:
count1: 5281420890
count2: 5281421068
delta: 178

The gap between guest and host is very small. One reason for this I
think is that it doesn't count the cycles in EL2 and host since we add
exclude_hv = 1. So the cycles spent to store/restore registers which
happens at EL2 are not included.

This patchset can be fetched from [1] and the relevant QEMU version for
test can be fetched from [2].

The results of 'perf test' can be found from [3][4].
The results of perf_event_tests test suite can be found from [5][6].

Also, I have tested "perf top" in two VMs and host at the same time. It
works well.

Thanks,
Shannon

* Add exclude_hv = 1 configuration to not count in EL2

Changes since v2:
* Directly use perf raw event type to create perf_event in KVM
* Add a helper vcpu_sysreg_write
* remove unrelated header file

Changes since v1:
* Use switch...case for registers access handler instead of adding
  alone handler for each register
* Try to use the sys_regs to store the register value instead of adding
  new variables in struct kvm_pmc
