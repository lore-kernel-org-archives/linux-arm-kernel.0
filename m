Agreed that we should be aiming for same behaviour as x86
rather than reinventing the wheel...

For incoming migration/loadvm the VM will be freshly *reset*,
but it will not be completely created from scratch. It's
possible for the user to run a VM for a bit, and then use
"loadvm" from the monitor to load an old snapshot. This
will do a qemu_system_reset() and then restore the state.
So in that case has_run_once won't be clear. (Would it be
OK to clear it when userspace does VCPU_INIT? What else
does it control?)

Isn't Marc's patch causing us to return an error to userspace?
(It does a 'return -1', at least -- does that get ignored at
a higher level?)

In principle, if userspace does:
 * stop all vCPUs
 * read the counter values from each vCPU
 * write the counter values back to each vCPU
 * resume vCPUs

this shouldn't cause time to do funny things, should it?
(ie the problem only occurs if we try to write the vCPU
counter value while only one vCPU is stopped).
