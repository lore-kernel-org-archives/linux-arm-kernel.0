It might be worth noting in the commit message that this change means
that any memory accesses the compiler decides to spill between uaccess_*
calls and the main asm block are unprotected, but that's unlikely to be
an issue in practice.

Passing the alternative down is somewhat confusing. e.g. in the futex
case it looks like we're only doing something when PAN is present,
whereas we'll manipulate TTBR0 in the absence of PAN.

If I've understood correctly, we need this to distinguish regular
load/store uaccess sequences (eg. the futex code) from potentially
patched unprivileged load/store sequences (e.g. {get,put}_user) when
poking PSTATE.PAN.

So perhaps we could ahve something like:

* privileged_uaccess_{enable,disable}()
  Which toggle TTBR0, or PAN (always).
  These would handle cases like the futex/swp code.
 
* (unprivileged_)uaccess_{enable,disable}()
  Which toggle TTBR0, or PAN (in the absence of UAO).
  These would handle cases like the {get,put}_user sequences.

Though perhaps that is just as confusing. ;)

Otherwise, this looks like a nice centralisation of the PSTATE.PAN
manipulation code.

Thanks,
Mark.
