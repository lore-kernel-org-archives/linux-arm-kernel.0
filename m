I really appreciate your work on these patches. If for any or all of these
you have more lines added/modified than me (or using any other better
metric), please make sure to change the author to be you with
`git commit --amend --reset-author` or equivalent.

Nit: I would call this precise_instrs_loop. How many cycles it takes is
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

Is there any chance we might need an isb here, to prevent the stop from happening
before or during the loop? Where ISBs are required, the Linux best practice is to
diligently comment why they are needed. Perhaps it would be a good habit to
carry over into kvm-unit-tests.

This is clearly the right feature register to check. Sorry to have
gotten excited about an inferior method.
