Subject: [PATCH 2/3] KVM: arm/arm64: Add ARM arch timer interrupts ABI
In-Reply-To: <20160927190806.22988-1-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
References: <20160927190806.22988-1-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>

From: Alexander Graf <agraf@suse.de>

We have 2 modes for dealing with interrupts in the ARM world. We can
either handle them all using hardware acceleration through the vgic or
we can emulate a gic in user space and only drive CPU IRQ pins from
there.

Unfortunately, when driving IRQs from user space, we never tell user
space about timer events that may result in interrupt line state
changes, so we lose out on timer events if we run with user space gic
emulation.

Define an ABI to publish the timer output level to userspace.

 capability via KVM_ENABLE_CAP ioctl on the vcpu fd. Note that this
 will disable the use of APIC hardware virtualization even if supported
 by the CPU, as it's incompatible with SynIC auto-EOI behavior.
+
+8.3 KVM_CAP_ARM_TIMER
+
+Architectures: arm, arm64
+This capability, if KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION indicates that it is available, means
+that if userspace creates a VM without an in-kernel interrupt controller, it
+will be notified of changes to the output level of ARM architected timers
+presented to the VM.  For such VMs, on every return to userspace, the kernel
+updates the vcpu's run->s.regs.timer_irq_level field to represent the actual
+output level of the timers.
+
+Whenever kvm detects a change in the timer output level, kvm guarantees at
+least one return to userspace before running the VM.  This exit could either
+be a KVM_EXIT_INTR or any other exit event, like KVM_EXIT_MMIO. This way,
+userspace can always sample the timer output level and re-compute the state of
+the userspace interrupt controller.  Userspace should always check the state
+of run->s.regs.timer_irq_level on every kvm exit.  The value in
+run->s.regs.timer_irq_level should be considered a level triggered interrupt
+signal.
+
+The field run->s.regs.timer_irq_level is available independent of
+run->kvm_valid_regs or run->kvm_dirty_regs bits.
+
+Currently the following bits are defined for the timer_irq_level bitmap:
+
+    KVM_ARM_TIMER_VTIMER  -  virtual timer
+
+Future versions of kvm may implement additional timer events. These will get
+indicated by additional KVM_CAP extensions.
