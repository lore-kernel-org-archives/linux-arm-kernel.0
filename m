I was under the assumption that any shareability constraints would apply
to _all_ registers that use that mechanism:
PENDBASER, PROPBASER, BASER(device), BASER(collection), CBASER.
That's why this common function.

Sure, actually I was hoping for your guidance here, since I couldn't
really wrap my mind around shareability in this virtualisation context.

Again this is for all registers as listed above. Do we need separate
constraints for different registers?

Pah ;-)
Will fix it ...

To be honest, I couldn't really make out what "outer cacheability"
actually means in the context of a guest having user space memory mapped.

Sure.

The meaning of 000 is different: for inner cacheability it means Device,
for outer it means "same as inner". So we need two functions here to
differentiate, don't we? Unless our constraints happen to be the same
for the two (by coincidence)?
Also I think you just requested different constraints for outer and
inner cacheability? Or did I miss something?

Isn't that what the function does? If the value is 000 or 001, it
changes it to WaWb, otherwise it keeps the value. At least that was what
I had in mind. WaWb is what the Linux ITS driver prefers, so this serves
as some sensible value here (I hope). It's a bit weird that these bits
are not a bitfield, so the ITS cannot report back a set of supported
attributes easily at once.

This is for BASER (both for collections and devices). It's a bit
unfortunate that this one just consists of the stem which the other
registers also share, so it's a bit hard to differentiate without
inventing a new name. I can add a comment, though.

Sure.

OK.

Thanks for having a look!
