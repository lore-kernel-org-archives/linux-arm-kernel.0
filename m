Subject: [RFC v5 13/13] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: forwarding control
In-Reply-To: <1426776951-24901-1-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
References: <1426776951-24901-1-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <1426776951-24901-14-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patch sets __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_KVM_VFIO_FORWARD and implements
kvm_arch_set_forward for ARM/ARM64.

As a result the KVM-VFIO device now allows to forward/unforward a
VFIO device IRQ on ARM.

kvm_arch_set_forward and kvm_arch_unset_forward mostly take care of
VGIC programming: physical IRQ/guest IRQ mapping, list register cleanup,
VGIC state machine.

Signed-off-by: Eric Auger <eric.auger@linaro.org>

---

v4 -> v5:
- fix arm64 compilation issues, ie. also defines
  __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_HALT_GUEST for arm64

v3 -> v4:
- code originally located in kvm_vfio_arm.c
- kvm_arch_vfio_{set|unset}_forward renamed into
  kvm_arch_{set|unset}_forward
- split into 2 functions (set/unset) since unset does not fail anymore
- unset can be invoked at whatever time. Extra care is taken to handle
  transition in VGIC state machine, LR cleanup, ...

v2 -> v3:
- renaming of kvm_arch_set_fwd_state into kvm_arch_vfio_set_forward
- takes a bool arg instead of kvm_fwd_irq_action enum
- removal of KVM_VFIO_IRQ_CLEANUP
- platform device check now happens here
- more precise errors returned
- irq_eoi handled externally to this patch (VGIC)
- correct enable_irq bug done twice
- reword the commit message
- correct check of platform_bus_type
- use raw_spin_lock_irqsave and check the validity of the handler
