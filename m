That's good if it works for them, and it seems the cleaner approach.

_If_ they run the new thread up to a checkpoint, restoring the memory
and doing all the setup that requires in-thread syscalls, then stop it
in ptrace to finally inject the regs, then it makes sense to set the
keys at that stop -- i.e., you set the keys atomically* with the final
setting of the thread's PC.

(* with respect to the target thread)

So long as you're confident they've understood the implications of
ptrauth for CRIU, I guess this can work.


(In other news, they will also need to do some work to support SVE, but
that's unrelated to ptrauth.)
