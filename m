While I appreciate this layout represents the absolute maximum an ITS
could implement, I'm a bit concerned about the amount of memory we may
end-up requiring here. All the ITSs implementations I know of seem to
get away with 8 bytes per entry. Maybe I'm just too worried.

Also, please mention that ITT_addr is actually ITT_addr[51:8], as we're
guaranteed to have an ITT that is 256 byte aligned.

The actual name is Interrupt Translation Entry (ITE). I have a patch
renaming this all over the vgic-its.c file...

Same concern here. 32bit DevID, EventID and INTID seem a bit over the
top. But maybe we shouldn't be concerned about memory... ;-)

You definitely want to relax this. An ITS implementation is allowed (and
actually encouraged) to maintain a coarse map in the first kB, and use
this to quickly scan the table, which would be very useful on restore.

Thanks,
