That was really what my initial question was about, and what I thought
the commit message should make abundantly clear, because that ties the
message together with the code.

Understood.

yes it does.

I don't think you've been evasive at all, I just think we reason about
this in slightly different ways, and I was trying to convince myself why
this change is safe and summarize that concisely.  I think we've
accomplished both :)
