It is not about what I think. It is about what the architecture gives you.

There cannot be any userspace mapping at EL2 when non-VHE, so there
cannot be any valid PAN setting. I repeat: there is not such thing as
PAN at EL2 when HCR_EL2.E2H==0. This bit *has no effect*. Just read the
documentation (ARM DDI 0487B.a, D4.4.2).

If you're going to change this kind of code, please start by
understanding the architecture.
