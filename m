I expressed my concerns as well, I'm definitely against merging this
series.

"Clean+invalidate" is a safe operation even if the guest accesses the
memory in a cacheable way. But if the guest can update the cache lines,
Qemu should avoid cache maintenance from a performance perspective.

The guest is either told that the DMA is coherent (via DT properties) or
Qemu deals with (non-)coherency itself. The latter is fully in line with
the B2.9 chapter in the ARM ARM, more precisely point 5:

  If the mismatched attributes for a memory location all assign the same
  shareability attribute to the location, any loss of uniprocessor
  semantics or coherency within a shareability domain can be avoided by
  use of software cache management.

... it continues with what kind of cache maintenance is required,
together with:

  A clean and invalidate instruction can be used instead of a clean
  instruction, or instead of an invalidate instruction.
