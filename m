No, and that's the whole point of this patch: the function pointers are
loaded into registers as PC-relative constants (adrp+add), the selection
being done by a mov or a nop. For example:

ffffffc0007f1f60:       90000001        adrp    x1, ffffffc0007f1000
ffffffc0007f1f64:       90000000        adrp    x0, ffffffc0007f1000
ffffffc0007f1f68:       91036021        add     x1, x1, #0xd8
ffffffc0007f1f6c:       910b0000        add     x0, x0, #0x2c0
ffffffc0007f1f70:       d503201f        nop
ffffffc0007f1f74:       aa1303e0        mov     x0, x19
ffffffc0007f1f78:       d63f0020        blr     x1

For the default condition (the above code), the CPU is likely to discard
the second adrp+add (because of the mov x0, x19). For the alternate, the
nop is replaced by a "mov x1, x0", which makes the first adrp+add
irrelevant (it will be eliminated in the pipeline of any decent CPU).

While this has a cost in terms of instruction footprint, the branch
predictor is quickly going to find out where we're branching. We also
avoid fetching both from the I and D sides, which could kill the branch
predictor if not speculated in time. In the end, we get something that
is a lot more predictable, even for simpler CPU designs.
