You mean that you want to specify this alignment attribute every time
you create an IOMMU mapping? Then you can set segment_boundary_mask
every time you create an IOMMU mapping. It's odd but it should work.

Another possible solution is extending struct dma_attrs. We could add
the alignment attribute to it.
