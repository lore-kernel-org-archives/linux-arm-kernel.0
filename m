Subject: [PATCH] ARM: KVM: Fix idmap stub entry when running Thumb-2 code
Message-ID: <20170420150221.15796-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

When entering the hyp stub implemented in the idmap, we try to
be mindful of the fact that we could be running a Thumb-2 kernel
by adding 1 to the address we compute. Unfortunately, the assembler
also knows about this trick, and has already generated an address
that has bit 0 set in the litteral pool.

Our superfluous correction ends up confusing the CPU entierely,
as we now branch to the stub in ARM mode instead of Thumb, and on
a possibly unaligned address for good measure. From that point,
nothing really good happens.

The obvious fix in to remove this stupid target PC correction.
