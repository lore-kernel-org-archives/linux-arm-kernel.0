The fact that this might happen silently seems to be a larger problem.

Can we do something like the EFI stub, and ensure that (unintentional)
references to symbols outside of the hyp-stub will fail to link? That's
ensrue by some symbol mangling in drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/Makefile.

I think this may have come up before; I can't recall if there was some
reason that was problematic.

Thanks,
Mark.
