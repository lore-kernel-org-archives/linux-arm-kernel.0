What I'm after is a meaningful discussion between ARM arch maintainers
and KVM maintainers - so far all I see are people on the ARM side of
things.

I've also yet to have any response on some of the KVM questions I raised
earlier in this thread - again, silence from KVM people.

What's also coming clear is that there's very few people who understand
all the interactions here, and the whole thing seems to be an undocumented
mess.  Something needs to change there - people need to stop shovelling
half baked crap into the kernel.  KVM have the privilege of being able to
push ARM stuff directly, I now see that was a very big mistake.

So, I want KVM further changes to come through my tree once this merge
window is over - and I want to see some documentation about how things
hang together, because hardly anyone understands it right now, and that's
_really_ bad.

Let's start with some documentation on the KVM hypervisor interfaces on
32-bit ARM.  Documentation/virtual/kvm/hypercalls.txt already contains
some for x86, s390 and PPC, so that would be a good place to document
the ARM side.  Arguably, that should have already been done.
