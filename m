No, the hosts ACPI/APEI tables describe host physical addresses, the guest can't
access these.

Instead we can use Linux's hwpoison mechanism to call memory_failure() and if we
pick the address carefully, signal Qemu. From there we can test Qemu's
generation of CPER records and signalling the guest.

When a host and a guest both use APEI the HEST tables will be different because
the memory layout is different, but the path through APEI and the kernel's error
handling code would be the same.

I agree, Qemu should make that decision, depending on the users choice it can
print a helpful error message and exit, or try and restart the guest.

I picked this as an example because its not clear what it means and it probably
affects the host as well as the guest. We need to do the host error containment
first.

My point was only that the architecture doesn't tell us the FAR is always set,
so we have to find out from somewhere else, like the host's CPER records.

SError Interrupt is one of the notification types for GHES which may be
triggered by firmware. Firmware should generate the CPER records before
triggering the SEI notification. When the host gets an SEI it can parse the list
of GHES addresses looking for CPER records. The asynchronous delay doesn't
affect the CPER records from firmware.

Qemu can do the same for a guest before it pends an SError.


> but it can still know which application create this SError which is deferred by ESB, then guest OS close the APP.

Once the host has done its error containment, yes. If the SError interrupted a
vcpu and the host signalled Qemu the signal will be delivered before the vcpu is
run again, (if (signal_pending(current))... in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run()).

If Qemu does its work and decides to pend an SError before running the vcpu
again then it will be as if the guest isn't running under a hypervisor.

It uses both. The FAR may get copied to the signal address if the ESR says the
FAR is valid. This works on systems that don't have APEI SEA.
Systems that do have APEI SEA will parse the CPER records as well to find the
physical address and do the memory_failure() routine to signal all the affected
processes, not just the one that was running.
