here's how this can happen: SW has filled the queue with commands, and
the queue doesn't drain. This is either the result of illegal commands
(and the queue has stalled), or a HW bug (and the queue has stalled).

In either cases, there is not much you can do to rescue your system
(although we could start to support the new stall model once actual
implementations are available).

Thanks,
