I was expecting the vfio_platform_register_reset() function to be
available by the time of step 2-2.

What I think is going on here is that we are still inside of the
module_init() function of the vfio-platform driver at the time that
we call the request_module(), and the symbols are not made visible
to other modules until the module_init function returns with success.
This is a side-effect of the probe function for the platform driver
getting called from deep inside of the platform_driver_register()
function for all devices that are already present.

I think it already works for the AMBA case, which uses separate modules,
but we need to restructure the platform_device case slightly to do
the same:
