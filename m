Yes, that would be great, but its all wrapped up in 'kernel first handling' for
RAS... which we don't yet have.

This series is 'fixing' the kernel's SError mask behaviour so that the SEI
firmware-first mechanism can (almost) always deliver its notifications, and has
somewhere to hook the APEI code into, (like you did for do_sea()).

Of course not all systems will have this firmware, so if we took a v8.2 RAS
SError on bare-metal we need to do something. This selective-ignoring is an
interim fudge to avoid bringing the machine down for something that isn't (yet?)
a problem.

Hmm, so RAS Daemon is going to end up knowing whether an error was handled
kernel-first or firmware-first, that is unfortunate for RAS-Daemon (more code)
and means we have duplicate trace points.

I agree, but only once we have code to dig in v8.2's RAS ERR registers to pick
out the class of error and affected component or address. Until then we can't
know the component or address, so can't handle the error.

This is still an improvement over a non-v8.2-RAS aware kernel, as that would
panic() for corrected errors too, (depending on when they arrived ... the SError
masking is somewhat broken).


Thanks,

James
