But wouldn't it be much better to fix the application in that case?
I can't see any reason why a user would call time() so often that
it shows up in CPU profiles, when the result only changes every
few billion CPU cycles.

Moreover, most architectures cannot return a time64_t from a
system call today, so we'd have to change the system call
entry points on all of those first to implement the slowpath
for a new time64() system call.
