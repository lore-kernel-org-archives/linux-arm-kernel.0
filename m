Subject: [PATCH v2 00/54] KVM: arm/arm64: Rework virtual GIC emulation
Message-ID: <1461861973-26464-1-git-send-email-andre.przywara@arm.com>

Hi,

this is another rework of the new VGIC series.
Most prominent changes this time include a complete rewrite of the MMIO
framework and splitting the emulation bits for GICv2 and GICv3 into
separate files (patch 20/54 and 21/54) - many thanks to Christoffer and
Marc for taking care of that.
We dropped support for userland save and restore of any GICv3 register,
as the ABI hasn't been fully agreed upon.
Also the arch_timer rework series has now been integrated (making up
the first seven patches), since it's a prerequisite for the new VGIC
and also not very useful without it.
Some fixes - especially for GICv3 emulation - have also been integrated.
The file names have been trimmed to all using dashes instead of a mixture
of dashes and underscores.
The patches that saw changes have had their changelog updated.

All the open issues that were mentioned in the last cover letter have
either been addressed or dismissed.

The series survived some testing on various hosts - both GICv2 and
GICv3, also 32-bit GICv2 hosts - and various guests.
Some basic cross-endian tests were done as well, with both 64-bit LE and
BE guests surviving boot and hackbench runs on a 64-bit BE host.
Also a 32-bit BE guest was booted successfully on a 64-bit LE host.

As this new VGIC emulation will probably become the default very shortly,
please test it full steam on whatever setup you have access to.
Any reports are warmly welcome.

This series is now based on v4.6-rc5.
A git tree containing this series can be found on linux-arm.org:

Cheers,

===========================
This series is a joint effort to re-implement KVM's GIC emulation.

While the current implementation is centered around providing
efficient MMIO emulation, the hot path for most guests is actually
the guest entry and exit, which currently is rather costly.
Also the existing emulation has a global distributor lock, which
quickly becomes a bottleneck once the number of VCPUs increases.
Additionally the emulation was originally designed for GICv2, adding
GICv3 ITS emulation support to this proved to be rather painful.
Last, but not least the existing code became less and less
maintainable, with many special cases handled explicitly.

The new implementation is build around a struct vgic_irq data
structure, which holds all information about a virtual interrupt.
Interruts which should be injected are held in a per-VCPU list, this
make the entry/exit path much more efficient. Also the new structure
allows to have more fine grained locking - per IRQ and per VCPU -
getting rid of the global distributor lock.
As a result of the new design ITS emulation fits in more nicely, the
respective code will be provided as a follow-up series.

This series implements the same feature set as the existing emulation,
as a goodie we now implement priorities correctly.
To allow an easy transition with good test coverage, but still maintain
stability, both implementations live side by side, selectable via a
Kconfig option. The default is the new implementation.
If this code proves to be reliable, we will later remove the current
implementation with an extra patch set.

Please have a look at the series, review it and give the code some
serious testing (and possibly debugging). All feedback is appreciated.

Cheers,
Andre.
