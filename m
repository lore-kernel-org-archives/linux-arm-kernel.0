Subject: [RFC/PoC PATCH 3/3] arm64: enable ROP protection by clearing SP bit
 #55 across function returns

ROP attacks rely on a large supply of so-called 'gadgets', which are
(in this context) short sequences of instructions ending in a stack
pop and a return instruction. By exploiting a stack overflow to create
a specially crafted stack frame, each gadget jumps to the next by
popping off the next gadget's address as a fake return address,
allowing non-trivial 'programs' to be executed by piecing together
a large number of such gadgets.

This attack vector relies heavily on the ability to jump to arbitrary
places in the code. If we could limit where a function could return to,
it is much more difficult to obtain critical mass in terms of a gadget
collection that allows arbitrary attacks to be mounted.

So let's try and do so by clearing bit #55 in the stack pointer register
before returning from a function, and setting it again right after a
'bl' or 'blr' instruction. That way, jumping to arbitrary places in the
code and popping the next gadget's address becomes a lot more complicated,
since the stack pointer will not be valid after a function return until
the 'reset' sequence is executed (or after an exception is taken).
