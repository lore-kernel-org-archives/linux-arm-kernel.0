If I convert this kind of thing to SIGKILL there really is nothing
sensible to put in si_code, except possibly SI_KERNEL (indicating that
the kill did not come from userspace).  Even so, it hardly seems worth
filling in fields like si_pid and si_uid just to make this "correct".

In any case, if siginfo is never seen by userspace for SIGKILL this is
moot.

Obviously, siginfo is never copied to the user stack in that case, but
is it also guaranteed not to be visible to userspace by other means?
For ptrace I'm hoping not, since SIGKILL should nuke the tracee
immediately instead of being reported to the tracer as a
signal-delivery-stop -- so the tracer should get WIFSIGNALED() &&
WTERMSIG() == SIGKILL.  A subsequent PTRACE_GETSIGINFO would fail with
ESRCH.

Does that match your understanding?

If so, there is some merit in not pretending to pass a reall value
for si_code.

Should si_code simply be ignored for the SIGKILL case?

Cheers
