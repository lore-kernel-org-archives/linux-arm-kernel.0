Curious, this is a kernel thread, which shouldn't have any fpsimd state
of its own.  It would be interesting to know what ran before, but tricky
to find that out now unless we can find a way to repoduce...

Maybe a thread flag has ended up in the wrong state.

This might be a race, or a missing piece of logic somewhere... I'll
take a look.
