Subject: [PATCH V5 2/4] coresight: adding path for STM device
In-Reply-To: <1459997479-19431-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
References: <1459997479-19431-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <1459997479-19431-3-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Mathieu Poirier <mathieu.poirier@linaro.org>

>From a core framework point of view an STM device is a source that is
treated the same way as any other tracers.  Unlike tracers though STM
devices are not associated with a CPU.  As such it doesn't make sense
to associate the path from an STM device to its sink with a per-cpu
variable as it is done for tracers.

This patch simply adds another global variable to keep STM paths and the
processing in coresight_enable/disable() is updated to deal with STM
devices properly.
