Subject: [PATCH 08/11] ARM64: mm: Swap PTE_FILE and PTE_PROT_NONE bits.
In-Reply-To: <1369328878-11706-1-git-send-email-steve.capper@linaro.org>

Under ARM64, PTEs can be broadly categorised as follows:
   - Present and valid: Bit #0 is set. The PTE is valid and memory
     access to the region may fault.

   - Present and invalid: Bit #0 is clear and bit #1 is set.
     Represents present memory with PROT_NONE protection. The PTE
     is an invalid entry, and the user fault handler will raise a
     SIGSEGV.

   - Not present (file): Bits #0 and #1 are clear, bit #2 is set.
     Memory represented has been paged out. The PTE is an invalid
     entry, and the fault handler will try and re-populate the
     memory where necessary.

Huge PTEs are block descriptors that have bit #1 clear. If we wish
to represent PROT_NONE huge PTEs we then run into a problem as
there is no way to distinguish between regular and huge PTEs if we
set bit #1.

As huge PTEs are always present, the meaning of bits #1 and #2 can
be swapped for invalid PTEs. This patch swaps the PTE_FILE and
PTE_PROT_NONE constants, allowing us to represent PROT_NONE huge
PTEs.
