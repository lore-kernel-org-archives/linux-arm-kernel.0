OK. I have implemented separate api for ISPENDR userspace access to
read soft_pending for level triggered interrupts. This needs kernel
implementation
to support separate api's for guest and userspace access.

 In the current implementation of vgic in kernel I could not find
any implement/support for GICD_STATUSR register value.
Should I leave this as RAZ / WI for now?.
