Yes, that's true. An oversight on my part.

Mapping LPIs to IRQs is not a problem, as LPIs don't have an active
state, so you never have to deactivate it, and you never put them in an
LR. Problem solved! ;-)

Alternative layout proposal for the ITS emulation case:

#define LR_IS_LPI	(1 << 4)

struct vgic_lr {
	union {
		unsigned lpi:24;
		unsigned spi:10;
		union {
			unsigned hwirq:10;
			unsigned source:8;
		};
	};
	unsigned state:5;
};

That gives you even more space than you had before.

Now, this is absolutely disgusting, of course. This whole intermediate
structure crap is completely getting out of control, and we should get
rid of it before we merge the ITS.
