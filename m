Subject: [PATCH 03/14] arm64: kernel: remove {THREAD,IRQ_STACK}_START_SP

From: Ard Biesheuvel <ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

For historical reasons, we leave the top 16 bytes of our task and IRQ
stacks unused, a practice used to ensure that the SP can always be
masked to find the base of the current stack (historically, where
thread_info could be found).

However, this is not necessary, as:

* When an exception is taken from a task stack, we decrement the SP by
  S_FRAME_SIZE and stash the exception registers before we compare the
  SP against the task stack. In such cases, the SP must be at least
  S_FRAME_SIZE below the limit, and can be safely masked to determine
  whether the task stack is in use.

* When transitioning to an IRQ stack, we'll place a dummy frame onto the
  IRQ stack before enabling asynchronous exceptions, or executing code
  we expect to trigger faults. Thus, if an exception is taken from the
  IRQ stack, the SP must be at least 16 bytes below the limit.

* We no longer mask the SP to find the thread_info, which is now found
  via sp_el0. Note that historically, the offset was critical to ensure
  that cpu_switch_to() found the correct stack for new threads that
  hadn't yet executed ret_from_fork().

Given that, this initial offset serves no purpose, and can be removed.
This brings us in-line with other architectures (e.g. x86) which do not
rely on this masking.
