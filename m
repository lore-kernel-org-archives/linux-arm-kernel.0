Hi Eric,

I'm aware of Peter's work to rework static keys, but that code is not
merged yet (though I believe it is on its way to 4.3). I have an
additional patch that repaints the code to use static_key_likely() all
over the place, but I keep it separate for the time being.

If this series makes it in for 4.3, I'll post the repainting patch after
-rc1. Otherwise, I'll just update it in my tree.

I'm about to post v4 anyway, and I'll mention this in the cover letter.

Thanks,

	M.
