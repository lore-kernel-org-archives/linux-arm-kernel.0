The issue I have is that struct _irqfd is local to eventfd.c so it
cannot be used in archi specific code. Is it acceptable to move it to
kvm_host.h, naming it something like kvm_kernel_irqfd (as done for
kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry)? Would also need to move _irqfd_resampler
there (kvm_kernel_irqfd_resampler).

irqfd user struct cannot be used in a standalone manner since we miss
the kvm handle.

Thanks
