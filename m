I'm mostly happy with this series at this point, and everything beyond
the ABI discussion can be fixed later if we should spot anything.

Assuming we can agree on the API for the level_info shortly, can you
address the other comments in the series and reabse on v4.10-rc4 (or rc5
if that's out when you get there) and send out a new version that we can
queue?

Thanks,
