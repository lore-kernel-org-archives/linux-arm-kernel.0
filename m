The goal is to make checkpointing and restoring processes work on
several different architectures and ABIs, in the face of Address Space
Layout Randomization (ASLR) and other factors that might change the VDSO
virtual address from one exec() to the next.

Here's the patch adding PowerPC support:

I'm sorry, but I don't understand this question. Are you saying ARM,
Power etc. need VDSO unmap and remap log that behave differently? So far
I've found the differences to be stylistic rather than really affecting
generated code behavior.

Thanks,
