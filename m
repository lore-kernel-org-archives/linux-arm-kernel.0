But if you mean [2], then I am confused, with regard to firmware on
physical hardware. Namely, even on physical machines, the firmware has
to estimate, in advance, the area size that will be needed for CPERs,
doesn't it? And once the firmware allocates that memory area, it cannot
be resized at OS runtime. If there are more CPERs at runtime (due to
hardware errors) than the firmware allocated room for, they must surely
wrap around in the preallocated buffer (like in a ring buffer). Isn't
that correct?

On the diagrams that you linked above (great looking diagrams BTW!), I
see CPER in two places (it is helpfully shaded red):

- to the right of BERT; the CPER is part of a box that is captioned
"firmware reserved memory"

- to the right of HEST; again the CPER is part of a box that is
captioned "firmware reserved memory"

So, IMO, when QEMU has to guesstimate the room for CPERs in advance,
that doesn't differ from the physical firmware case. In QEMU maybe you
can let the user specify the area size on the command line, with a
machine type property or similar.

Thanks
