Thanks for having given it a go.

This warning occasionally shows up on the same platform even without
these patches (it is just harder to trigger). This is an artefact of the
way KVM treats the virtual timer, disabling it on exit and expecting it
to immediately retired from the CPU interface. This works just fine on
all systems, except for this platform where it seems to take a bit more
time.

Trapping things at EL2 introduces just enough additional latency that we
end-up exiting with a pending interrupt more often than without the
trapping, trigger this warning.

The good news is twofold: this is completely harmless (we just get an
extra interrupt on the host), and Christoffer is working on patches that
will change the way we handle this so that we actually make use of that
interrupt.

Thanks,
