But if we do that, we also change the layout that EL1 expect. Assume we
do something like this:

u64 *current_lr = cpu_if->vgic_lr;

switch (max_lr_idx) {
	case 15:
		current_lr++ = read_gicreg(ICH_LR15_EL2);
	case 14:
		current_lr++ = read_gicreg(ICH_LR14_EL2);
	[...]
}

with max_lr_idx = 4 (a common case), we end up filling vgic_lr[0..3],
while the rest of the code expects it in vgic_lr[12..15]. This defeats
the point of being able to replace the world switch without changing the
rest of the code. It also means that the position of a given LR in
memory now depends on a runtime constant instead of a compile-time constant.

If you had something different in mind, please give me some sample code,
because I'm a bit lost as to what you really have in mind.

This doesn't have much to do with ARMv7 vs ARMv8, but with the GIC
architecture (well, ARMv7 doesn't support GICv3, so that's a moot point):

- GICv2: max 64 LRs (in practice, GIC400: 4 LRs)
- GICv3: max 16 LRs (in practice, Cortex-A57: 4 LRs)
