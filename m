Ah, I just saw your other comment about other arches not having support
for the rel32 offsets :-/

The asymmetry still bothers me though. Can't we have something that just
switches relative crcs on and off, that applies to *both* vmlinux and modules?
Then we can get rid of the crc_owner check in check_version() and just have
something like:

   if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_RELATIVE_CRCS))
       crcval = resolve_crc(crc);

Also we could get rid of the '&& !defined(MODULE)' checks scattered in
export.h. Then the arches that want relative crcs and that *do* have rel32
relocation support can turn relative crcs on, and powerpc can enable it, right?

Would that work or is there another reason this won't work with modules
(assuming that the arches that select this option support the relative
offsets)?
