Subject: [RFC PATCH 2/3] arm64: boot: align __inittext with swapper block on
 relocatable kernels
In-Reply-To: <1487173081-13425-1-git-send-email-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

The relocatable kernel needs to do a relocation pass regardless of whether
it was loaded at the virtual offset it was linked at. This means we could
completely ignore TEXT_OFFSET if we wanted to (and this is actually what
the KASLR aware image loader in the stub does already), as long as we adhere
to the segment alignment, which is at least 64 KB.

Whether the .init.text region requires a RWX mapping depends on whether it
shares a swapper block with other sections that require a writable mapping.
Since the TEXT_OFFSET field gives us control over the placement of the Image
with respect to a swapper block boundary, we can override its value with a
value that puts __inittext_begin right on a swapper block boundary as well.
This removes the need to use RWX mappings entirely, given that relocatable
kernels have at least a couple of MBs of .rela data, which sits between
the executable and the writable bits of the __init segment.
