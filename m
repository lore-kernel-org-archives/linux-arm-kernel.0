There should probably be a comment on this.

SVE vector-length agnostic software needs to be able to assume that
VL <= 256 (the SVE maximum), because some instructions won't work as
expected if this is not the case, particularly TBL, where in a larger
vector there's no guarantee that a vector index (which might be as small
as a byte) can index a vector element (of which there could be >256).

I really don't want to expose SVE_VL_ARCH_MAX to userspace, so that
people are not tempted to design data structures and protocols that
can't handle up to SVE_VL_MAX.  Exposing both together seemed to carry
a high risk of confusion and misuse.

Instead, I silently clamp to an SVE-compatible length (i.e.,
SVE_VL_ARCH_MAX) in sve_set_vector_length().  If future architecture
revisions support larger vectors later on, my plan is to require an
extra "force flag" to be passed to override the clamp.

[...]
