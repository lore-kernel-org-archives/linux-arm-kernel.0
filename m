Hmm, is that really true?  Earlier versions of the Armv8 Arm ARM, for
the description of CPTR_EL2.TFP:

  This causes instructions that access the registers associated with
  Floating Point and Advanced SIMD execution to trap to EL2 when
  executed from EL0, EL1, or EL2, unless trapped to EL1.

In the current version I think you can arrive at the same conclusion by
looking at the FPEXC_EL2.EN description which tells you that if EN==0,
then the instruction is UNDEFINED, and the Synchronous exception
prioritization rules specify that undefined instructions are taken
before trapped intructions because of CPTR_EL2.

But there does seem to be some inconsistency with the description of
generally trapping floating point access to EL2.
