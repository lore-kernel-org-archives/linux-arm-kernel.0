Isn't there a situation then where the guest can get stuck because we
don't properly check for signal handling?

As I recall, we have the lcoal_irq_disable() call before checking
signal_pending(), so that if, for example, another thread sends a signal
to that VCPU we either:
 (1) handle the IPI and see we have a signal pending, so we abort, or
 (2) don't handle the IPI because IRQs are disabled, enter the guest but
     soon as we run the guest the interrupt hits, we go back, see the
     signal and exit.

There was something like this which caused a guest to get stuck with
userspace timers on v7.

Am I making sense at all?
