Re-think about this. Since there are different operates to SET/CLR
registers, maybe it should keep both of them while only storing the
state in one of them.

To SET:
	vcpu_sys_reg(vcpu, r->reg) |= val;
To CLR:
	vcpu_sys_reg(vcpu, r->reg) &= ~val;

Or keep one of them and within the access handler, according to the
operates encoding value to judge whether it's SET or CLR.
