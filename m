The previous assembly implementation we did was design as you
described but all checks were done after the pending work was managed.
I would like the address limit check to be done before, especially if
we move from panic to a SIGKILL approach.

How do you think it could improve while keeping the check before pending work?

I don't use the label anymore on this version.
