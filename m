I'm very happy to see the generalization overall, as this is going
to make it much easier to add the 64-bit time_t on the 32-bit
vdso implementations, as well as other extensions we may want
in the future.

Makes sense.

I would prefer to have that named clock_gettime.c and only implement
that one system call there. We can easily have the gettimeofday(),
time() and clock_getres() in the common code where that is needed
for backwards compatibility. As I already mentioned in my comment
for one of the patches, we won't have time() or gettimeofday() system
calls on new architectures, and 32-bit architectures won't have them
with 64-bit time_t.

I suppose we can have the time() and gettimeofday() calls
implemented in the generic vdso for everyone, but then
only hook those up on architectures that already had
them. The implementation of course is trivial based on
clock_gettime() with CLOCK_REALTIME or CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE
respectively.

Ah, I missed the fact that you didn't do this for x86, so I assumed that
this work was triggered by Thomas' recent cleanup of the x86 clock_gettime
vdso code. I think it would be best to get x86 to use the same code and
get the recent improvements ported to the others as well that way.
