Nope.  Like I said, i considered making the debugging mandatory.  I
may still send patches to do that.

For example: a bug in entry logic, a bug in perf NMI handling, or even
a bug in *nested* perf NMI handling (egads!).  Or maybe some super
nasty interaction with suspend/resume.  These are all fairly unlikely
(except the nested perf case), but still.

As a concrete example, back before my big NMI improvement series, it
was possible for an NMI return to invoke espfix and/or take an IRET
fault.  This *shouldn't* happen on return to a context with CR0.WP
set, but it would be incredibly nasty if it did.  The code is
separated out now, so it should be okay...

I don't think we disagree here.  A leak would be a case of incorrectness.

I'm imagining the power to (a) cause some code path to execute while
the kernel is "open" and (b) the ability to use the buggy code path in
question to write a a fully- or partially-controlled address.  With
CR0.WP clear, this can write shellcode directly.  With CR3 pointing to
a page table that maps some parts of the kernel (but not text!) at a
randomized offset, you need to figure out the offset and find some
other target in the mapping that gets your exploit farther along.  You
can't write shellcode directly.

Exactly the same way.  Map those regions at the same offset, maybe
even in the same VMA.  There's no reason that an artificial VMA used
for this purpose can't be many gigabytes long and have vm_ops that
only allow access to certain things.  But multiple VMAs would work,
too.

It's a restriction on what targets can be hit.  With CR0.WP, you can
hit anything that has a VA.  With CR3, you can hit only that which is
mapped.

There's no code here making the checks at write time.  It's just page
table / VMA setup.

I mean auditing all uses of pax_open_kernel() or any other function
that opens the kernel.  That function is, as used in PaX, terrifying.
PaX probably gets every user right, but I don't trust driver writers
with a function like pax_open_kernel() that's as powerful as PaX's.

Suppose you get driver code like this:

void foo(int (*func)()) {
  pax_open_kernel();
  *thingy = func();
  pax_close_kernel();
}

That would be a very, very juicy target for a ROP-like attack.  Just
get the kernel to call this function with func pointing to something
that does a memcpy or similar into executable space.  Boom, shellcode
execution.

If CR3 is used instead, exploiting this is considerably more complicated.
