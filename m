When the trap is not actually an instruction emulation - e.g. setting up
the page tables on a fault. Because we are in the act of single-stepping
an instruction that didn't actually execute we erroneously return to
userspace pretending we did even though we shouldn't.

It doesn't currently (at least for aarch64, the aarch32 skip code does
more messing about). But the decision isn't really about futzing with
the single-step flags but about returning to userspace so the
single-step is seen. Changing a > 0 to return to the guest to a 0 to

Well that's a little more complex. We actually exit to handle the MMIO
stuff and then return so it can complete before exiting again for the
step (see virt/kvm/arm/arm.c):

	if (run->exit_reason == KVM_EXIT_MMIO) {
		ret = kvm_handle_mmio_return(vcpu, vcpu->run);
		if (ret)
			return ret;
		if (kvm_arm_handle_step_debug(vcpu, vcpu->run))
			return 0;
	}
