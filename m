I was worried about that (which was also why I didn't Cc stable on this,
because we shouldn't pretend that glibc and the kernel are synchronised),
but the value *is* incorrect and glibc has already been updated. In
other words, not merging this patch is also problematic, because we're
advertising a size that's significantly too small.

Would you rather we kept the old incorrect value in the kernel headers?
