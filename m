I'm sorry, but I can't manage to parse this commit message. How about
something like this?

"kvm_vcpu_dabt_isextabt() tries to match a full fault syndrome, but
 calls kvm_vcpu_trap_get_fault_type() that only returns the fault class,
 thus reducing the scope of the check. This doesn't cause any observable
 bug yet as we end-up matching a closely related syndrome for which we
 return the same value.

 Using kvm_vcpu_trap_get_fault() instead fixes it for good"

Otherwise:
