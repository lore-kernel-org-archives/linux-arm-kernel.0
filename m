255 with the gic series, not yet merged. Even if you have a dozen arrays
with that as the size, then unless your array element size is huge (on
the order multiple pages), then it probably doesn't matter. Using the
default memory allocation of a QEMU guest, 128 MB, unit tests have plenty
of memory at their disposal. The framework itself only allocates a handful
of pages.

Of course the framework also supports dynamic memory allocation, so you
could do malloc(nr_cpus * element_size), to avoid excess.

Thanks,
