I wouldn't bother trying to rationalise gas' behaviour here.  I think
it's an accident of implementation rather than there being some
fundamental reason for it.

AFAICT gas could quite happily resolve ldr= in exactly the same way as
.long and thus not have this problem.  But we can't rewrite history.

Ewww... I think it'd be best to add a comment explaining that.

There's a fair change someone will trip over this at some point (or
worse, "fix" the assembly errors).

Meh.  Oh well.
