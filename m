Subject: [PATCH 18/26] ARM: dts: r8a7794: add audio clocks
In-Reply-To: <cover.1471251169.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

Message-ID: <0b1f0e374404f70b77c0f79c6f16fdcf5484552b.1471251169.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

From: Sergei Shtylyov <sergei.shtylyov@cogentembedded.com>

Describe  the external audio clocks (signals AUDIO_CLK[ABC]) required by
the sound driver.  Boards that provide audio clocks need to  override the
clock frequencies.

This patch is based on the commit 0d3dbde84a45 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7791:
add  audio clock on DTSI").
