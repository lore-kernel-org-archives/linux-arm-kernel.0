Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Stackleak for arm64
In-Reply-To: <dc76a745-3fa7-4023-dcc1-3df18c9461a6@redhat.com>

This is the arm64 version of the STACKLEAK plugin originall from
grsecurity. See
https://marc.info/?l=kernel-hardening&m=151880470609808 for the
full x86 version. This is based on top of Kees' branch for stackleak
and has been cleaned up to use a few macros from that branch.

Comments welcome, if there are no major objections Kees will queue this
up to get some CI testing. This passed both of the LKDTM tests.
