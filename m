All Transparent Huge Pages are allocated by the buddy allocator.

A compile time check is in place that fails when the order of a
transparent huge page is too large to be allocated by the buddy
allocator. Unfortunately that compile time check passes when:
HPAGE_PMD_ORDER == MAX_ORDER
( which is incorrect as the buddy allocator can only allocate
memory of order strictly less than MAX_ORDER. )

This patch updates the compile time check to fail in the above
case.
