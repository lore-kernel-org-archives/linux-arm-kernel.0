Subject: [PULL 00/12] KVM/ARM Fixes for v4.8-rc3

Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here's a set of KVM/ARM fixes for v4.8-rc3 or as soon as you can make
it.  They address:
 - ITS init issues
 - ITS error handling issues
 - ITS IRQ leakage fix
 - Plug a couple of ITS race conditions
 - An erratum workaround for timers
 - Some removal of misleading use of errors and comments
 - A fix for GICv3 on 32-bit guests

Note that the patch previously submitted 'KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Grab
kvm->lock when reading kvm->devices', was dropped from this series
because we were already holding the kvm->lock in the call path to the
ITS code.

The following changes since commit 29b4817d4018df78086157ea3a55c1d9424a7cfc:

  Linux 4.8-rc1 (2016-08-07 18:18:00 -0700)

are available in the git repository at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm.git kvm-arm-for-v4.8-rc3
