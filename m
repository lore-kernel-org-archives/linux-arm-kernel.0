Okay, good. I'll respin the patch to use ppoll (which was Bamvor's
original suggestion to me, IIRC).

Yeah, that's my next project on this front.

As far as I know, yes. I just happened to set up the testing around
poll as it was easiest to trigger for me.

I don't think there's any one way things operate, unfortunately. I
need to map out the behaviors, since sometimes ptrace sees things
differently from seccomp (which leads to no end of confusion on my
part). I will try to generate a comparison across several
architectures.
