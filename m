That would be a userspace specific trigger, as nothing requires userspace
to describe anything like that. QEMU does inform the guest that it is a
KVM guest through SMBIOS for ACPI boots, though. When the guest is boot
with DT the guest can infer that it's at least a QEMU guest by the
existence of the fw-cfg DT node. However that heuristic isn't good enough
to tell the difference between TCG and KVM, so it's unlikely to be helpful
here.

There were some patches on the KVM list once proposing that KVM provide
a PV interface allowing KVM guests to populate the /sys/hypervisor sysfs
node (which was invented for xen). But those patches were for x86, and
also seem to have been abandoned.

Thanks,
