So, I actually spent some more time looking at this due to the
comments from rmk on arm32, and I don't think any whitelist is needed
here at all. (i.e. it can be *offset = *size = 0) This is because all
the usercopying I could find uses static sizes or bounce buffers, both
of which bypass the dynamic-size hardened usercopy checks.

I've been running some arm64 builds now with this change, and I
haven't tripped over any problems yet...
