This is a hack! Just because AEMIF driver is enabled, it does not
guarantee that the timings have been setup by it. Instead of configuring
timings in two drivers, why not just convert everyone over to use the
new driver. Dont worry about breaking old platforms, I will help test
and ack them.

Thanks,
