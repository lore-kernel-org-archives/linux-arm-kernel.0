I thought LPIs had strict fire-and-forget semantics, not allowing any
active state, and that they are either pending or inactive?

Perhaps you're asking if LPIs have active state semantics on real
hardware and thus supports threaded interrupt handling for LPIs?

That is not supported on real hardware, which I think addresses your
concerns.
