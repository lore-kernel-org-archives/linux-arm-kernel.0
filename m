Hi Christoffer,

I realize this is already merged, but I have a question about the
above hunk. IIUC, the patch "KVM: arm/arm64: Move timer/vgic
flush/sync under disabled irq" only moved kvm_vgic_flush_hwstate()
under disabled irq because it had to be run after
kvm_timer_flush_hwstate(). Now that kvm_timer_flush_hwstate() is
gone can/should it be moved back out?

Thanks,
drew
