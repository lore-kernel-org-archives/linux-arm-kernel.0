So the idea is kvm_ prefix will be used for handling either hyp or stage2
depending on what we are dealing with (i.e, kvm parameter to the helpers).

So here, we just want to know if a given pmd represents a huge page, either
via thp or via hugetlb and that doesn't have anything to do with hyp or stage2.
Hence the change. As

Correct. In this case it doesn't apply to kvm_pmd_huge().

Yes, I have switched to that in the next version.
