This I'll need to check with our ASIC team, and it may take a while.

Note indirect access to the config registers is done with two registers
within pcie->base, one specifies the
address/bus/device/function/read/write direction and the other specifies
the data. All other registers in the block pointed to by pcie->base
really have nothing to do with config register access. They are used for
other block related configurations.
