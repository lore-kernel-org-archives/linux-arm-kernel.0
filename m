The ARM ARM uses 'TLB' to mean any internal storage used by the translation,
including internal registers. So it's not necessarily a TLB entry in the usual
sense.

Most of these make more sense if you consider that Stage-2 'TLBs' might cache
this information for the purpose of walking Stage-1 entries. There are other
potential reasons beyond that, though.

I thought that too, but this could race with concurrent modification on another
CPU. That other CPU would perform maintenance with the usual ASID, then perhaps
modify/free entries.

There would be a window where the CPU doing the EPD0 + reserved-ASID trick
could have an erroneous view of the page tables, and walk garbage or allocate
conflicting entries.

Perhaps the ASID allocation logic could be modified to avoid that race, though.

Thanks,
Mark.
