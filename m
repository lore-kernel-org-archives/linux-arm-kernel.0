I would say that whilst it is a very dangerous thing to do and has many
consequences, there is a requirement for a gdb user to be able to change VL
whilst debugging a running process, and I don?t think we should see
changing VL as much different from changing a register value on the fly.

Say you have a loop in assembly you are trying to debug - you might write
to $x2 and then single step to see how this effects the result. With SVE
code you might want to see how different VL values will effect the layout
of results in the vectors, how it effects the predicates and how it changes
the number of iterations the loop makes. Of course, once you exit the
loop all bets are off - just like if you had been changing register values.

The current proposal for gdb is that we will show $VL in the list of
registers, therefore for consistency it?d make sense for the gdb user to
be able to set it as if it was just another register. For this we need a
simple way to change the VL in another process, and I think ptrace() is
the easiest way (given that prctl() only changes its own process).

Thanks,
