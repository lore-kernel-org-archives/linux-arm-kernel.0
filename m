Hi Russell,

Just a quick reply expressing my opinion on the ABI and KVM maintenance
topics. Sorry I won't be able to follow up until the new year as I go on
holiday soon.

IMO, the interface between EL1 and EL2 _is_ ABI. However, it should not
be confused with a *stable* ABI like the one we expose to user. Since
all users of the EL2 ABI live inside the kernel (either on the EL1 or
EL2 side), we are free to change it as long as everything is updated
simultaneously. I don't see this any different from other in-kernel ABI
like that exposed to loadable modules (for the latter, we have the
advantage of a partly self-documenting ABI as part of the C language).

I would welcome some documentation for the EL2 ABI as well, especially
since head.S and the KVM counterpart is maintained by different people.

I'm afraid I strongly disagree. There are a few reasons neither you nor
me gatekeep the KVM port: (a) the ARM KVM maintainers know a lot more
about KVM than either of us, (b) the KVM code under arch/arm is reused
by arm64 and (c) you or I would certainly become a bottleneck. There is
a lot more to KVM support on ARM than the hyp stub and realistically you
won't have the time to review all the stuff that comes your way.

Just because there is an interface between two or more pieces of code,
it is not a strong enough argument for them to have the same gatekeeper
(I wouldn't say maintainer since IMO this implies a lot more). That
said, you can always advise other maintainers on how to do things right,
ask for proper documentation (as you did), review how things are defined
and implemented, especially when they touch code _you_ maintain.

I'm all for documenting the interface.

(even though Will and I co-maintain arch/arm64, I deliberately kept his
name out of the above as I haven't had the chance to ask for his
opinion on this matter, which may as well differ)

I have to go and pack now. Merry Christmas!
