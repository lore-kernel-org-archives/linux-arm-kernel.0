Right.  And someone else will insist on wrapping the kernel into a boot 
loader specific image format e.g. u-Boot.  If all those variations could 
be kept out of the kernel build that would be a good thing.

That means the kernel should be wrapped/compressed/scrambled at 
installation time, not at build time.  This way the kernel image remains 
universal and flexibility in its installation is possible.

I don't think we'll have to concern ourselves with tightly constrained 
systems that much on ARM64.
