With READ_IMPLIES_EXEC propagation, several hundreds times of
__sync_icache_dcache operations shows up than not READ_IMPLIES_EXEC
propagation, which degenerating the system performance. Changing arm64
only would settle our problem down, thanks for figuring out previously.

Seems that arch/arm had discussed the propagation of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC:
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2012-February/086490.html
But the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC is still not cleared in elf_set_personality().

OK, this mail Cc to linux-arch. Thanks.
