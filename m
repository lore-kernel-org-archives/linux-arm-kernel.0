Subject: [PATCH 123/228] cpufreq: spear: don't initialize part of policy that
 is set by core too
In-Reply-To: <cover.1379063063.git.viresh.kumar@linaro.org>

To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Many common initializations of struct policy are moved to core now and hence
this driver doesn't need to do it. This patch removes such code.

Most recent of those changes is to call ->get() in the core after calling
->init().
