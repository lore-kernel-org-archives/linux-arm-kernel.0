Hi Marc,

I've verified the basic GICv4 functionality with v2 series + Eric's IRQ
bypass patches on QDF2400 platform with a minor change in vgic-init.c
successfully.  Nice, I don't  see any deadlock or catastrophic issues
running on QCOM hardware. You can add my tested-by, I'll provide comments
after reviewing giant v2 series.

Subject: [PATCH v2 00/52] irqchip: KVM: Add support for GICv4

Yes, it's been a long time coming, but I really wasn't looking forward to
picking this up again. Anyway...

This (monster of a) series implements full support for GICv4, bringing
direct injection of MSIs to KVM on arm and arm64, assuming you have the
right hardware (which is quite unlikely).

To get an idea of the design, I'd recommend you start with patch #32, which
tries to shed some light on the approach that I've taken. And before that,
please digest some of the GICv3/GICv4 architecture documentation[1] (less
than 800 pages!). Once you feel reasonably insane, you'll be in the right
mood to read the code.

The structure of the series is fairly simple. The initial 34 patches add
some generic support for GICv4, while the rest of the code plugs KVM into
it. This series relies on Eric Auger's irq-bypass series[2], which is a
prerequisite for this work.

The stack has been *very lightly* tested on an arm64 model, with a PCI
virtio block device passed from the host to a guest (using kvmtool and
Jean-Philippe Brucker's excellent VFIO support patches[3]). As it has never
seen any HW, I expect things to be subtly broken, so go forward and test if
you can, though I'm mostly interested in people reviewing the code at the
moment.

I've pushed out a branch based on 4.12-rc6 containing the dependencies (as
well as a couple of debug patches):

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maz/arm-platforms.git
kvm-arm64/gicv4-kvm

* From v1:
  - The bulk of the 30-something initial patches have seen countless
    bugs being fixed, and some key data structures have been subtly
    tweaked (or killed altogether). They are still quite similar to
    what I had in v1 though.
  - The whole KVM code is brand new and as I said above, only lightly
    tested.
  - Collected a bunch a R-bs from Thomas and Eric (many thanks, guys).
