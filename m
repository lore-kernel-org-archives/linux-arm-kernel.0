Subject: [RESEND PATCH V4 1/4] stm class: provision for statically assigned
 masterIDs

From: Mathieu Poirier <mathieu.poirier@linaro.org>

Some architecture like ARM assign masterIDs at the HW design
phase.  Those are therefore unreachable to users, making masterID
management in the generic STM core irrelevant.

In this kind of configuration channels are shared between masters
rather than being allocated on a per master basis.

This patch adds a new 'mshared' flag to struct stm_data that tells the
core that this specific STM device doesn't need explicit masterID
management.  In the core sw_start/end of masterID are set to '1',
i.e there is only one masterID to deal with.

Also this patch depends on [1], so that the number of masterID
is '1' too.

Finally the lower and upper bound for masterIDs as presented
in ($SYSFS)/class/stm/XYZ.stm/masters and
($SYSFS)/../stp-policy/XYZ.stm.my_policy/some_device/masters
are set to '-1'.  That way users can't confuse them with
architecture where masterID management is required (where any
other value would be valid).
