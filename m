This is just you then. No-one else has your imp-def:RAS error ESR values.

This would be like me adding some impdef branch instruction, then claiming
aarch64_insn_is_branch() doesn't take account of my private additions.

I agree the name is assuming all architected ESR are RAS-errors, and that impdef
ESR are just that: impdef, that's all we know about them. Unless this causes us
to do the wrong thing, I don't think it matters.
Obviously we would need to change it if a new architected ESR is added.

This is actually worse, because there is an architected ESR for 'uncategorized',
that the helper papers-over and treats as uncontained. Calling it 'categorized'
means we now have three states, not two.
