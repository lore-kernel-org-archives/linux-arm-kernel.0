I don't think die() helps us, its not quite the same as oops_begin()/panic(),
which means we're interpreting the APEI notification's severity differently,
depending on when we took it.

I think the purpose of this oops_begin() is to ensure two CPUs calling
oops_begin() at the same time don't have their traces interleaved, unblanks the
screen and 'busts' any spinlocks printk() may need (console etc).

This code is called in_nmi(), printk() now supports this so it doesn't need its
locks busting.
When called in_nmi(), printk batches the messages into its per-cpu
printk_safe_seq_buf, which in our case is dumped by panic() using
printk_safe_flush_on_panic(). So provided we call panic(), the in_nmi() messages
from ghes.c are already batched, and printed behind panic()'s atomic_cmpxchg()
exclusion thing.

If your arm64 system has one of these futuristic 'screens', they get unblanked
when panic() calls console_verbose() and bust_spinlocks(1).

Today its just x86 and arm64. arm64 doesn't have a hook to do this. I'm happy to
add an empty declaration or leave it under an ifdef until someone complains
about any behaviour I missed!


Thanks,
