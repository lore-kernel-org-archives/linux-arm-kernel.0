Ah, you meant, if we are in vgic_sync_hwirq() and the dist state is
active, then we have the virtual state still at pending or active?

That's a slightly different question from what you posed above.

I haven't thought extremely carefully about it, but could you not have
(1) guest deactivates (2) physical interrupt is handled on different CPU
on host for passthrough device (3) VFIO ISR leaves the IRQ active (3)
guest exits and you now hit vgic_sync_hwirq() and the virtual interrupt
is now inactive but the physical interrupt is active?

Sounds good!  Thanks.
