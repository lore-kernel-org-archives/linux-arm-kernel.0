I'm quite pleased with the overall look of this series. It fixes a
number of issues that have been around for a while, plus some others
I've recently introduced...

Now, I fear this is probably too big a series to be shipped as a fix for
4.3. Can you come up with a minimal series that we could merge quickly
(I'm thinking patches 7 and 9), and leave the rest for the following
merge window?

Thanks,

	M.
