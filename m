Subject: [PATCH v6 00/10] arm64: Add support for KVM with ACPI
Message-ID: <1460388780-914-1-git-send-email-julien.grall@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Hello,

This patch series allows KVM to work with ACPI on ARM64.

Currently, the firmware tables are parsed by the the virtual timer and virtual
GIC code in order to configure them correctly.

However the parsing of these tables is already done in the GIC and arch timer
drivers. This patch series introduces new helpers to retrieve the information
from the different drivers in order to avoid duplication of the parsing code.

To make the merge easier via the different trees, each patch modifies a single
subsystem. The suggested plan to merge the series is divided in 3 steps:

1) Patches #1-#2 are merged via the clocksource tree
   Patches #2-#7 are merged via the irqchip tree
2) Patches #8-#9 are merge via the KVM tree
3) Patch #10 is merged via the clocksource tree.

For all the changes see in each patch.

Regards,
