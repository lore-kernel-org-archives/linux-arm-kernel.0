Sorry that was unclear. If you use NOTIFY_SEI, the guest may have PSTATE.A set,
in which case the the CPU will patiently wait for it to unmask, (or consume it
with an ESB-instruction), before delivering the notification. The guest may not
have unmasked SError because its hammering the same page taking the same fault
again and again. Pending the asynchronous notification and re-running the vcpu
doesn't guarantee progress will be made.

In this case user-space can spot its pended an asynchronous notification (for
the same address!) more than once in the last few seconds, and try something
else, like firing a guest:reboot watchdog on another CPU.

I'm wary that this only works for errors where we know the guest PC accessed the
faulting location.

The arch code will send this signal too if user-space touches the PG_poisoned
page. (I recall you checked Qemu spots this case and acts differently).
Migration is the obvious example for Qemu read/writing guest memory.

On x86 the MachineCheck code sends these signals too, so our kernel-first
implementation may do the same. As a response to a RAS error notified by
synchronous-external-abort, this is fine. But we need to remember '_AR' implies
the error is related to the code the signal interrupted, which wouldn't be true
for an error notified by SError.

There are two things going on here, firstly the guest may have masked PSTATE.A,
and be hammering an unmapped page. (this this 'sorry that was unclear' case
above). This would happen if the exception-entry code or stack became corrupt
when an exception was taken.
The second is what does existing non-RAS-aware software do? For SError it
panic()s, whereas for synchronous external abort there are some cases that can
be handled. (e.g. on linux: synchronous external abort from user-space).

I think you're saying "lets keep it KVM for now, Qemu doesn't have a better idea
of what to do."


Thanks,
