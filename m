This patch has the unfortunate side effect of breaking kvmtool 
(although the ITS support patches are not merged yet). The code 
sequence now requires that KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT has been issued 
on the ITS *before* we can set the ITS base address.

I find it a bit odd (I see KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT as a way to say 
"I'm done, do what you must and make it work"), but that's obviously 
what QEMU must be doing (the save/restore sequence hints at that, but I 
only just realized the issue). Of course, kvmtool does the opposite.

But now that we've coupled setting the address and mapping the iodev, 
there is not much that's left for KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT, and I 
wonder why we're keeping it (other than for backward compatibility)?

We're now unable to set the address more than once (fair enough). What 
is also interesting is that this makes it plain obvious that we have a 
race between setting the address and registering the device (no lock is 
taken here, and two threads could try and play a dirty game on us).

I've come up with the two following patches, that seem to make it work.

Thanks,

	M.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Get rid of its->initialized field

The its->initialized doesn't bring much to the table, and creates
unnecessary ordering between setting the address and initializing it
(which amounts to exactly nothing).

Let's kill it altogether, making KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT the no-op
it deserves to be.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Plug race between ITS base address
 setting and iodev registration

We set the ITS base address (and other fields) outside of the critical
section, leaving the door open for two thread to race on changing the
fields.

Change vgic_register_its_iodev() to take an address parameter, and
move all the initialization inside the mutex-protected section.
