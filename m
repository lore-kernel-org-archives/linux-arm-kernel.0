Oh, I'm not saying it is nice. It would hit us on the exception return
to userspace for all tasks (and not only the mitigated ones). I'd rather
not have this at all.

I agree. The semantics are really odd (the thread still runs unmitigated
until it traps into the kernel), and I don't really get why seccomp
tasks should get a special treatment compared to the rest of the userspace.

But 4.17 is only something like 10 days away, so whatever we decide,
we'd better decide it soon.
