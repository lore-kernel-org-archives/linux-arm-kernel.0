Subject: [PATCH 02/13] drm: sun4i: add support for H3 mixers
In-Reply-To: <20170801131304.7741-1-icenowy@aosc.io>
References: <20170801131304.7741-1-icenowy@aosc.io>

From: Icenowy Zheng <icenowy@aosc.xyz>

Allwinner H3 SoC has two mixers, one has 1 VI channel and 3 UI channels,
and the other has 1 VI and 1 UI. There's also some graphics post-process
function that is missing on mixer1, however, as we currently support
none of these functions, the only difference that is shown to us is the
channel number difference.

Add support for these two variants.
