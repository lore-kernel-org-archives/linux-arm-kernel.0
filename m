Subject: [RFC PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Don't let userspace update CNTVOFF once
 guest is running
Message-ID: <1435157697-28579-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Userspace is allowed to set the guest's view of CNTVCT, which turns
into setting CNTVOFF for the whole VM. One thing userspace is not supposed
to do is to update that register while the guest is running. Time will
either move forward (best case) or backward (really bad idea). Either way,
this shouldn't happen.

This patch prevents userspace from touching CNTVOFF as soon as a vcpu
has been started. This ensures that time will keep monotonically increase.

QEMU seems to trigger this at boot time, and I have no idea why it does so.
It would be good to find out, hence the RFC tag.
