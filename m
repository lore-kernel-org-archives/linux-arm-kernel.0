Subject: [PATCH V3 0/6] Introduce CoreSight STM support
Message-ID: <1454756672-12790-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patchset adds support for CoreSight STM IP block. It also makes
a little modification to the generic STM framework to cover the
CoreSight STM requirements. Full description follows the changelog.

Changes from v1:
 - Added a definition of coresight_simple_func() in CS-STM driver to
   avoid the kbuild test robot error for the time being.  This
   modification will be removed when merging the code in which the
   coresight_simple_func() has been moved to the header file.
 - Calculate the channel number according to the channel memory space size.

Changes from V2:
 - Changed to return -EFAULT if failed on the command STP_GET_OPTIONS.
 - Used Alex's patch [1] instead of the last 2/6.
 - Removed the while loop from stm_send(), since the packet size passed
   to it isn't larger than 4 bytes on 32-bit system and 8 bytes on
   64-bit system.
 - Removed stm_send_64bit(), since the process of packets on 64-bit
   CS-STM should be basically the same with on 32-bit system, except the 
   maximum length of writing STM at a time.
 - Removed the support of writing 64-bit to CoreSight STM buffer at a time
   on 32-bit ARM architecture according to an ARM engineer suggestion.  As
   he said that the STM might receive a 64-bit write, or might receive a
   pair of 32-bit writes to the two addressed words in either order.
   So 64-bit write isn't guaranteed to work on the ARM 32-bit architecture.

Thanks,
Chunyan
