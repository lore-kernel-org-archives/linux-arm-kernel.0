Consider the following case: heterogeneous system with CPU0 that has
HBP, and CPU1 that has HEL. CPU0 is using its own vector slot, and CPU1
should be using an extra one (it doesn't have a dedicated slot).

When CPU0 claims its vectors, it will get the "normal" version of the
mapping. And then, if we're using cpus_have_cap, we turn that into an
out-of-line mapping. That's not completely wrong (the system still runs
fine), but that's not the expected behaviour. If we restrict the second
phase to this_cpu_has_cap(), we get the expected CPU0 using the normal
mapping, and CPU1 does the exact opposite (which we also want).

Fair enough, that's a good point.

We're definitely in a non-preemptible section at this stage. On !VHE,
we're in IPI context (cpu_init_hyp_mode), and on VHE we are in the
switch code, having disabled interrupts a long time ago.

Nit: massive buglet here, which I thought I had squashed in the series,
and obviously didn't (still have it as a fixup). It should read:

vect = kern_hyp_va(kvm_ksym_ref(__bp_harden_hyp_vecs_start));

Thanks,
