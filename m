That's a great question.

I think my reasoning was, that since we now disable the VCPU interface
(and thereby maintenance interrupts), any logic that relies on a
maintenance interrupt firing and causing a guest exit after we've called
flush, would no longer work if we move this back out where interrupts
are enabled.

Thinking about this a bit more, I don't think that would ever make
sense, and we should be able to move it out.

I've tested these patches pretty heavily and would want such a change to
get the same kind of exposure, so I can start testing it, and if there
are no issues, put it in next later on in the cycle.

Does that sound reasonable?

Thanks,
