Subject: [PATCH 03/11] dt-bindings: power: add R8A77970 SYSC power domain
 definitions
Message-ID: <20170912210514.517628239@cogentembedded.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Add macros usable by the device tree sources to reference R8A77970 SYSC
power domains by index.

Based on the original (and large) patch by Daisuke Matsushita
<daisuke.matsushita.ns@hitachi.com>.
