If I'm understanding things correctly, some allocators zero the memory
by default and others do not.  And we have an unknown number of drivers
which are assuming that the memory is zeroed.

Correct?

If so, our options are

a) audit all callers, find the ones which expect zeroed memory but
   aren't passing __GFP_ZERO and fix them.

b) convert all allocators to zero the memory by default.

Obviously, a) is better.  How big a job is it?

This patch will help the process, if people use it.

It might be helpful to provide a runtime knob as well - having to
rebuild&reinstall just to enable/disable this feature is a bit painful.
