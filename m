The cover letter linked this article which talked through the
motivation: https://lwn.net/Articles/653585/

Essentially an "__iomem" annotation on a cached mapping is
inconsistent as __iomem indicates "may have side effects, use special
accessors" and cached means "pre-fetching, asynchronous write-backs,
and cpu determined i/o sizes are permissible".
