The only report I can think of about this was Pavel using an upstream
kernel for in-house Samsung development on non-public hardware.

But, again, I didn't look at the patches in detail yet, I'm not
categorically against them, I will take a careful look at them like I do
with all patches on the kvmarm list.  There's a risk they'll break in
mainline unless we sort out our testing story, and it may just be
something we'll have to live with.

I don't disagree with this.  I don't know what this has to do with the
part of my mail you're replying to, but I completely agree that the
current userspace irqchip support has limited value.
