Subject: [PATCH 1/7] ARM: dts: imx53-tx53: Relicense the TX53 dts files under
 GPLv2/X11
In-Reply-To: <1507720061-27666-1-git-send-email-LW@KARO-electronics.de>
References: <1507720061-27666-1-git-send-email-LW@KARO-electronics.de>
Message-ID: <1507720061-27666-2-git-send-email-LW@KARO-electronics.de>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The current GPL only licensing on the dts files makes it very
impractical for other software components licensed under another
license.

In order to make it easier for them to reuse our device trees,
relicense our dts files first under a GPL/X11 dual-license.
