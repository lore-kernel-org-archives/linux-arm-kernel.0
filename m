It's not strictly related to ARM binaries, however it is related to
AArch32 CPU features being supported and detected by the kernel.
Currently, with CONFIG_COMPAT disabled, we won't have access to a
(meaningful) compat_elf_hwcap.

I was actually looking to enforce the 32-bit binaries to only see
PER_LINUX32, though with a risk of breaking the ABI. OTOH, people are
abusing this and write 32-bit apps relying on the 64-bit /proc/cpuinfo:
