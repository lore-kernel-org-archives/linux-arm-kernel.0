Subject: [PULL 0/5] KVM/ARM Fixes for v4.15 - Round 2

Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here's another handful of fixes for KVM/ARM for v4.15.  They fix:
 - A bug in our handling of SPE state for non-vhe systems
 - A bug that causes hyp unmapping to go off limits and crash the system on
   shutdown
 - Three timer fixes that were introduced as part of the timer optimizations
   for v4.15


The following changes since commit 50c4c4e268a2d7a3e58ebb698ac74da0de40ae36:

  Linux 4.15-rc3 (2017-12-10 17:56:26 -0800)
