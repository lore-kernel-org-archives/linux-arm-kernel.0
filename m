True, I guess we'd need to measure that vs. the extra cost of switching
to/from the reserved ASID.

Right, only if you don't do the invalidation for the current ASID.

I doubt that would work, unfortunately. Whilst the writes are atomic
from the point-of-view of the TCR, if the fields can be cached in the
TLB logic, then we can't guarantee the atomicity of changes to the
cached state. Nice idea, though!
