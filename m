The value needs to be taken in a hopefully-inlined function if you want to catch
LKDTMs 'just off the stack' writes. Doing it like this saved meddling with the
generic code.

Sure, do you want to give this a go? (I have my hands full at the moment)

It might not be the right check on all architectures, x86 redzone comes to mind,
but it doesn't look like they use this in the kernel.


There is also Al Viro's uaccess unification work that may affect whether this is
worth doing now:
