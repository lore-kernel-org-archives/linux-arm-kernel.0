Hi, Will,

Chazy and me are talking about how to reduce the saving/restoring
overhead for debug registers.
We want to add a state in hw_breakpoint.c to indicate whether the host
enable any hwbrpts or not (might export a fuction that kvm can call),
then we can read this state from memory instead of reading from real
hardware registers, and to decide whether we need a world switch or
not.
Does it acceptable?
