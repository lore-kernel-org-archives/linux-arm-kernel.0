Hi Eric,

thanks for the review!

Good point, will do.

Ah yes, this was a leftover from a previous version of the series. I had
V2M in-kernel emulation implemented at some time, but later dropped that.
Thanks for spotting.

Yes, that seems to make some sense. The original idea was to make sure
that all of those addresses are properly initialized regardless of the
chosen guest model, but I see that this gets messy and would probably be
better solved by moving those assignments.

Thanks,
Andre.
