Not too late to rename it. Scoped write? I think it makes change to
use a different API than PaX for portability too, but not a different
x86 implementation. It's quite important to limit the writes to the
calling thread and it needs to perform well to be introduced widely.

Meanwhile, the PaX implementation has improved to avoid the issues
that were brought up while only introducing a single always-predicted
(due to code placement) branch on the overflow flag. That seems to
have gone unnoticed upstream, where there's now a much slower
implementation that's not more secure, and is blocked from
introduction in areas where it's most needed based on the performance.
Not to mention that it's opt-in... which is never going to work.
