If you're preempted, vcpu_put will be called.  See kvm_preempt_ops in
virt/kvm/kvm_main.c.

here, you do:

	ldr r4, HCPTR_TTA
	vfp_skip_if_dirty skip_vfp_trap
	orr r4, r4, #(HCPTR_TCP(10) | HCPTR_TCP(11))
skip_vfp_trap:
	set_hcptr vmentry, r4

if that works with the necessary rework of set_hcptr to take a register,
if the orr can be encoded propertly etc.  Maybe it's not worth it, it
just feels weird to touch this registers twice.  Perhaps the nicer fix
is to just rename/refactor set_hcptr to be two functions, set_hcptr_bits
and clear_hcptr_bits.
