And my bad was that I hadn't gone to the effort of understanding my own
argument -- I'd glad to be called out on that.

OK, good.  I reposted speculatively on this basis :)

The commit message is in better shape now, and I very much appreciate
you kicking the tyres on my reasoning!

OK, good.

Was this reasonably understandable?  If so I could use it as a basis for
improving the comment block in fpsimd.c, but I'd want to squash it down
to the essentials.  It's pretty verbose as it stands.

(What I'd really like to do it take an axe to the logic so that we
end up with something that doesn't require anything like this amount
of explanation ... but that's more of an aspiration right now.)
