Ah, right, thank for a tip! ;)

I was about to try it out, but didn't manage to find a branch with
vgic-trap series, so I did a quick fixup for my series and now it is
running non-VHE boot tests and I don't expect issues with VHE one. I
think diff bellow should work runtime too, but if you do want me to give
it a try it'd be handy to have a branch I can pull from ;)

I did this a bit different:

+struct vgic_global __section(.hyp.text) kvm_vgic_global_state =
{.gicv3_cpuif = STATIC_KEY_FALSE_INIT,};

Thanks
