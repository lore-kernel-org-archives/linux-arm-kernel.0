I think we would need a few more uaccess_enable_* variants (cache
maintenance, Xen) which makes this impractical.

We can consider the PAN_NOT_UAO the special case and if we assume that
UAO also implies PAN (ARMv8.2), we can define uaccess_enable_not_uao()
for the get_user etc. cases. We would use uaccess_enable() for the rest.
