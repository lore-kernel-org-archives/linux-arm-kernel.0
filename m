But failing migration is a good thing, right? How do you expect that
the guest will be happy to see a new CPU revision right in the middle
of its execution? Do you also propose that QEMU starts doing that for
big-little systems? After all, if ignoring the differences in some
registers is harmless for migration, surely that should be the case in
a single system, right?

You're changing the ABI without any buy in from userspace, which is
not acceptable.

As it stands, this patch creates a number of issues without solving
any. Things to think about:

- How does errata management works when migrating to a different
  system?
- big-little, as mentioned above
- Are all invariant registers equal? A different MIDR has the same
  effect as a different MMFR0?

Instead of papering over architectural constants i a system, how about
allowing the relevant ID registers to be overloaded when not
incompatible?

Thanks,
