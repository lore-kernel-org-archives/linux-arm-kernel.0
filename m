Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: tegra124-apalis: Correct license text
Message-ID: <20170328080638.17017-1-alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The license test has been mangled at some point then copy pasted across
multiple files. Restore it to what it should be.
Note that this is not intended as a license change.

Acked-by: Marcel Ziswiler <marcel.ziswiler@toradex.com>
Signed-off-by: Alexandre Belloni <alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>
