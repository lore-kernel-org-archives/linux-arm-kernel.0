is that FUD or do you have actionable information to share?

why is that? cr0.wp exists since the i486 and its behaviour fits my
purposes quite well, it's the best security/performance i know of.

correct.

i've got 14 years of experience of maintaining it and i never saw it break.

unless it's optional code as the whole feature already is.

this is not *the* proper solution, but only a naive one that suffers from
the exact same need that the cr0.wp approach does and has worse performance
impact. not exactly a win...

verifying it is no different than verifying, say, swapgs use.

why and where would cr0.wp leak?

your 'proper' solution needs (a lot more) extra stuff too.

because you've been misled by the NIH crowd here that the PaX feature they
tried to (badly) extract from has anything to do with frequency of writes.
it does not. what it does do is provide an environment for variables that
are conceptually writable but for security reasons should be read-only most
of the time by most of the code (ditto for the grossly misunderstood and thus
misnamed ro-after-shit). now imagine locking down the page table hierarchy
with it...

you forgot to add 'for a window of a few insns' and that the map/unmap
approach does the same under an attacker controlled ptr.

it is for people who care about the integrity of the kernel, and all this
read-onlyness stuff implies that some do.
