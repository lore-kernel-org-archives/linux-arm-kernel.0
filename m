Yes, for a single version of the ABI where all the entries are 64-bit.

I don't think there's anything wrong with the current version, and
you're right, this always points to an ITS data structure which is LE,
so there shouldn't be a problem.  I always just quiver when I see void
pointers cast to a type in the caller and callee.

Just leave it for now.
