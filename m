Historically I wanted to play safe.

I meant to change this to enable_dbg_and_irq now, but it looks like I
forgot to do it.

I'll double-check that do_sve_acc() does nothing that makes it unsafe to
enable irqs, but it should be OK.  It's certainly _intended_ to be
irq-safe.

Yes, and this is required for correctness, as you observe.

I had a BUG_ON() here which I removed, but it makes sense to add a
comment to capture the precondition here, and how it is satisfied.

There should be no way to reach this code with TIF_SVE set, unless
task_fpsimd_load() sets the CPACR trap bit wrongly, or the hardware is
broken -- either of which is a bug.

Agreed, I think this does need more explanation...  I'm currently
trying to figure out the best way to describe it.
