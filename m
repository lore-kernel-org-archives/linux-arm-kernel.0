We also elide the fact that single-stepping is happening from the guest
here by piggy backing the step bit onto cpsr() as we enter KVM rather
than just tracking the state of the bit.

The current flow of guest debug is very much "as I enter what do I need
to set" rather than tracking state between VCPU_RUN events.

Yes - treating all exits as potential emulations is problematic and we
are increasing complexity to track which exits are and aren't
actual *completed* instruction emulations which can also be a
multi-stage thing split between userspace and the kernel.

Nope it gets done before during decode_hsr in mmio.c:

	/*
	 * The MMIO instruction is emulated and should not be re-executed
	 * in the guest.
	 */
	kvm_skip_instr(vcpu, kvm_vcpu_trap_il_is32bit(vcpu));

That is a little non-obvious but before guest debug support was added it
makes sense as the whole trap->kernel->user->kernel->guest cycle is
"atomic" w.r.t the guest. It's also common code for
in-kernel/in-userspace emulation.

For single-step we just built on that and completed the single-step
after mmio was complete.
