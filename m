On arm64 with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK, a stack overflow will result in a
panic(). My understanding was that the same is true on x86.

In this case, panic() can also corrupt the neighbour stack, and could
also fail.

When CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is not selected, a stack overflow simply cannot
be handled reliably -- while panic() may be more likely to succeed, it
is not gauranteed to.

Sure, I'm certainly happy with panic() here.

I believe that CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK is seen as a debug feature,
and hence people don't select it. I strongly doubt that people have
reasons to disable it other than not wanting the overhead associated
with debug features.

I think it is reasonable to panic() here even with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
selected.

Regardless of whether we BUG() or panic(), we're hoping for the best.

Consistently using panic() here will keep things simpler, so any failure
reported will be easier to reason about, and easier to debug.

Thanks,
Mark.
