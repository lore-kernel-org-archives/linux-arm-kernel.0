Sure. With that, it would make sense for the trapped LOR* register
accesses to UNDEF, as they logically shouldn't exist.

Having looked at the ARM ARM, I think write_to_read_only() is the right
thing to do.

It's not clear to me whether HCR_EL2.TLOR traps writes to LORID_EL1, or
leaves these UNDEFINED at EL1. In the description of traps and enables
it's stated that HCR_EL2.TLOR traps "Non-secure accesses to this
register from EL1", which could be read to mean either. I'll see if I
can get to the bottom of that.

I don't think trap_raz_wi(), as LORID_EL1 is never RW at EL1, and a
write wound UNDEF were HCR_EL2.TLOR clear.

Thanks,
Mark.
