I agree. I had a look at QEMU as you suggested offline. Looks like QEMU
emulate these registers with predefined values for each core type. Also
it looks like it's not using the existing DEMUX_ID_CCSIDR

If we can conclude there are no users for DEMUX_ID_CCSIDR, we can remove
it all together instead of introducing new one for 64bit.

Are there any other users of these interface provided by KVM after from
kvmtool and qemu ?
