Yes it should, but it lost since v4. I'll restore it.

ILP32 is ABI acronym that means "Integers, Longs and Pointers are 32-bit".
And LP64 means "Longs and Pointers are 64-bit".

There's AN490 - "ILP32 for AArch64 Whitepaper" from ARM which covers
the topic:
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dai0490a/ar01s01.html

And some talks:
http://connect.linaro.org/resource/bkk16/bkk16-305b/

Briefly, ILP32 is 32-bit ABI that works with AARCH64 instruction set. It looks
better in some performance tests, and is useful for compatibility with 32-bit
legacy code.

If you're more familiar with x86 terminology, in ARM world LP64 corresponds
to x86_64, AARCH32_EL0 corresponds to x86_32, and ILP32 corresponds to x32
ABI.

I'll add link to AN490 in next submission.
