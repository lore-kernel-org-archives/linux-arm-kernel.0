Sorry, as I said above, my main focus was get the user ABI sorted out as
a code is public and there are people that started using it. There are
still a few emails marked as "unread" in my inbox that need to be
addressed but I did not consider them critical for version 3 of the
series. They are not forgotten, however, I'm working back through those
emails and either reply or implement the suggestions.
