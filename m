Thanks for you suggestion.
After discussed this issue internally in our side,  I think this should be our firmware issue.
Not a common issue.
so let us ignore the issue that hardware does not record physical error address.

When happen SEA, if the {D,I}FSC is 0b0101xx which is SEA on translation table walk or hardware update of translation
table, it means the page table itself happen issue, not the target address error.
For this case, even firmware can report a error page table physical address, but memory_memory()
can not recognize this address because the page table address is not belong to any task include Qemu,
so memory_failure() will not deliver SIGBUS. Of course, this is memory address.
I ever make a  experiment, if a APP's page table itself generated SEA, memory_failure() will consider it
as unknown issue. please see below log, I think this should be a common issue. so in KVM code, I plan to separately
handle the page table error of SEA if the {D,I}FSC is 0b0101xx, and not call memory_failure(), what do you think about that?
only the memory access SEA call memory_failure().

I mean the physical address. Because SEI is asynchronous, so usually firmware will not record this address,
If not record this address, the memory_failure() will be not called, then SIGBUS will not be sent, then guest will
not know there is SEI happen, so for this case may be we should also inject a virtual SError to avoid the issue that
physical address is not record.

how about the address is not accurate?
For SEI, even we can get a physical address from ERR<n>ADDR, but this address is not accurate.
so firmware will make it as invalid or not record it.
