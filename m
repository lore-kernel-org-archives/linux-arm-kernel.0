... because then you wipe all the cached translations for current
userland, which I suppose is best avoided. Wiping the reserved ASID
only discards TLB entries that should not exist in the first place.

No, but EPD0 does not disable translations, it disable translation
table walks on TLB misses, so we need to switch ASIDs to prevent user
space accesses via TLB hits.


But, how about we store the reserved ASID in TTBR1_EL1 instead, and
switch TCR_EL1.A1 and TCR_EL1.EPD0 in a single write? That way, we can
switch ASIDs and disable table walks atomically (I hope), and we
wouldn't need to change TTBR0_EL1 at all.
