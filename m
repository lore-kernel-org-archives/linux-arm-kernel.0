Ah, it looks like load_elf_binary() sets the personality after
flush_old_exec(). Looking at powerpc and x86, they set USER_DS to the
maximum 64-bit task value, so they should have a similar issue with
native 32-bit vs compat behaviour.

So what exactly is LTP complaining about? Is different error (like
EFAULT vs EINVAL) or not getting an error at all.

(I need to update my LTP, the preadv tests appeared in December last
year)
