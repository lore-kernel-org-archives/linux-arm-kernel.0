This seems to prevent races by protecting the store by a mutex, but

we should still have a race as we clear ioctl only after releasing the
lock.  For example malicious userspace could break KVM terms of use and
issue !KVM_RUN followed by KVM_RUN, so we would have these races:

   !KVM_RUN                             |   KVM_RUN

   mutex_lock_killable(&vcpu->mutex);   |
   vcpu->ioctl = !KVM_RUN;              |
   ...                                  | mutex_lock_killable(&vcpu->mutex);
   mutex_unlock(&vcpu->mutex);          |
                                        | vcpu->ioctl = KVM_RUN;
                                        | kvm_arch_vcpu_load() // variant 1
   vcpu->ioctl = 0;                     | ...
                                        | kvm_arch_vcpu_load() // variant 2
                                        | vcpu_put()

where the observed value of vcpu->ioctl in vcpu_put() would not
correctly pair with vcpu_load() or worse, kvm_arch_arch_load() in
KVM_RUN would execute with vcpu->ioctl = 0.

I think that other (special) callsites of vcpu_load()/vcpu_put() have a
well defined IOCTL that can be used instead of vcpu->ioctl, so we could
just pass the ioctl value all the way to arch code and never save it
anywhere,

thanks.
