Many thanks for taking the time to write this down

If I understand it correctly you still need 2 loaded modules (VFIO
driver & XGBE driver which implements the reset function) or am I
missing something?

I had a similar mechanism of registration in my PATCH v1 but I did the
registration from the reset module itself instead of in the native
driver, as you suggest here.
