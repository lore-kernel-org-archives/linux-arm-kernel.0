IMHO, it makes sense to keep the compat_sys_personality() as implemented
above. You may want to start a chroot ARMv7 environment using "linux32"
but don't want some 32-bit app calling personality(PER_LINUX) (as that's
the default personality on an ARMv7 system) and unknowingly changing the
personality that you wanted to enforce via "linux32".

I agree with not setting the personality based on the ELF type, but
that's different from the compat_sys_personality().

Late topic for the KS :).

I don't think we can move this behaviour to sys_personality. We may want
to add a generic compat_sys_personality() if we agree on the above
use-case.
