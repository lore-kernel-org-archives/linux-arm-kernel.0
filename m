Subject: [PATCH v3 03/27] KVM: arm64: Make kvm_condition_valid32() accessible

As we're about to trap CP15 accesses and handle them at EL2, we
need to evaluate whether or not the condition flags are valid,
as an implementation is allowed to trap despite the condition
not being met.

Tagging the function as __hyp_text allows this. We still rely on
the cc_map array to be mapped at EL2 by virtue of being "const",
and the linker to only emit relative references.
