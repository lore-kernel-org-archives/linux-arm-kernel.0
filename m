Are BUG_ON statements every 'really needed' ?

yes, that's why it's a BUG_ON, don't ever do this;)

I don't see a problem with having it there and I put it there because I
wanted to protect us (developers) against accidentally writing a patch
that reuses this function for a non-forwarded edge-triggered interrupt,
which is not supposed to ever happen.
