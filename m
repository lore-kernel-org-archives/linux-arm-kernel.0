Yeah, good point. I think this was a left-over from an earlier version
where I'd forgotten about that detail.

Right, __wr_rare is actually marked as .data..ro_after_init, which gcc
effectively ignores (thinking it's part of .data), but the linker
script later movies this section into the read-only portion with
.rodata. As a result, the compiler treats it as writable, but the
storage location is actually read-only.

(And, AIUI, the constify plugin makes things read-only in a similar
way, though I think it's more subtle but still avoids the
const-optimization dangers.)
