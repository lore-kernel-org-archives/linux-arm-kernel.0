I read the above two paragraphs many times but simply couldn't find
anything actionable in there.

That's also a solution but it adds another entry to sysFS, something
that could be avoided by tweaking the output we get from the current
infrastructure.  But I'm not strongly opinionated on that and I can go
along with this suggestion - as long as users (that aren't familiar
with the particulars of an STM) have a way of knowing what's going on.
