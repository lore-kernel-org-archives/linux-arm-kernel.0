(assuming you mean we _are_ the only user here, which I can acknowledge)

That sounds indeed tempting, but the comment on the struct kvm_exit_mmio
declaration reads:
/*
 * The in-kernel MMIO emulation code wants to use a copy of run->mmio,
 * which is an anonymous type. Use our own type instead.
 */
How I understand this the structure was introduced to _not_ use the same
memory, but use a copy instead. Do you remember any reason for this? And
in how far is this type anonymous? It's even in an uapi header.

Briefly looking at the code we do quite some memcpy on the way.
I am about to go all the way down into that ARM MMIO handling cave now
to check this (Marc, if I am not showing up again after some hours,
please come and rescue me ;-)

Cheers,
Andre.
