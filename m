the defines being used below are v2 specific and it's going to stay that
way.  But ok, if you think it will be reworked to cater for both v2 and
v3, fine.

I think that should work, yes.

Even if you're doing a restore of the state before actually running your
VCPUs, the make all requests wouldn't do anything and your VCPUs would
block in the early part of the run loop.  They will call
first_run_init() though, but I can't easily make that out to be a
problem.

An alternative is to do something similar to kvm_vgic_create(), perhaps
factor out that logic, which grabs the mutexes of all vcpus.
