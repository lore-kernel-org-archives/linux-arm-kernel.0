Verifying all these __copy_to/from_user() calls is rather non-trivial.
For example, I had to understand that the access_ok() check actually
spans memory that both user->sigframe and user->next_frame point into.
And it isn't clear to me that all users of apply_user_offset() are
within this range too, along with other manually calculated offsets in
setup_sigframe().

And it's not clear if parse_user_sigframe() is safe either. Are
user->fpsimd and user->sve checked somewhere? It seems like it's
safely contained by in sf->uc.uc_mcontext.__reserved, but it's hard to
read, though I do see access_ok() checks against __reserved at the end
of the while loop.

Can we just drop all the __... calls for the fully checked
copy_to/from_user() instead?
