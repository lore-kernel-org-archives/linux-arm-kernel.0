Hello Marek,

Thanks for the patch. We had found below two challenges when using UMM 
related to the cache invalidate/flush after/before performing the DMA 
operations:

a) when using HIGH_MEM pages, the page-table walk consumed lot of time 
to get the KVA of each page. Moreover the overhead was from the spinlock 
we acquire/release for each of the page.

b) One of my colleague tried to map/unmap the buffers only once instead 
of every time(which results in this problem) and we didn't find 
significant performance improvement. The reason is (as per my knowledge) 
when we give address range to cache controller to invalidate/flush out, 
the hardware operation is too fast(if there were any cache lines 
associated with the pages at all) to add any overhead to the CPU operation.

But this patch makes logical flow for dma-mapping one step closer :) I 
will adopt it as part of pulling all your new patches, and will keep you 
updated of any new findings.

Regards,
Subash
