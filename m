Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Clean dcache to PoC when changing PTE due to
 CoW
Message-ID: <20180823153342.158230-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

When triggering a CoW, we unmap the RO page via an MMU notifier
(invalidate_range_start), and then populate the new PTE using another
one (change_pte). In the meantime, we'll have copied the old page
into the new one.

The problem is that the data for the new page is sitting in the
cache, and should the guest have an uncached mapping to that page
(or its MMU off), following accesses will bypass the cache.

In a way, this is similar to what happens on a translation fault:
We need to clean the page to the PoC before mapping it. So let's just
do that.

This fixes a KVM unit test regression observed on a HiSilicon platform,
and subsequently reproduced on Seattle.
