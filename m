Good question, I bind kvmtool to cpu1, I think that's an A57.

I meant x2, but this compiles with aarch64 compiler and runs on Juno. Appears
like compiler may have an issue.

This is generated compiler code using the do { ... } while code.

Yes definitely, the do {....} while does bunch of mrs then bunch of str,
probably leads to out of order execution, eliminating the write after read
dependency.
Right now I don't know the compiler option that leads to this optimization.

Will do that in the future. This series performs no worse  then assembler one
and the huge change is the clean C code and other advantages. Optimizations
could maybe be deferred for future revisions.
