Hmm, the ICV_BPR0_EL1 says:
  "An attempt to program the binary point field to a value less than the
  minimum value sets the field to the minimum value. On a reset, the
  binary point field is set to the minimum supported value."

But then the ICV_BPR1_EL1 says:
  "An attempt to program the binary point field to a value less than the
  reset value sets the field to the reset value."

  and

  "Writing 0 to this field will set this field to its reset value, which
  is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED and non-zero."

So it seems like the spec is making some distinction between minimum or
reset value and between the two registers, but I'm not sure if the spec
is just having its fun with us, or if there's something important to be
aware of here.

Meh, probably not worth it.
