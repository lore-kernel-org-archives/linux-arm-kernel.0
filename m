Good point!

Sure,

I like the idea. It's a bit strange that do_mem_abort() looks up the table entry
to call the handler, which looks up the table entry to find out what it should
do. (__do_user_fault() already does this).

This would change all of 'fn's prototypes, to save the struct-siginfo
duplication in do_sea() and __do_user_fault().

Should the 'leaf' helpers still send the signal, or update the siginfo and
return back to do_mem_abort()? Getting things like do_alignment_fault() in a
kernel stack trace is the only reason I can see...


Thanks,

James
