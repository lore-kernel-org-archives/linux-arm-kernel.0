I can't imagine the compiler being stupid enough to read this multiple
times, but better safe than sorry. +1 for READ_ONCE().

I don't see how we get this RES0/Aff3 mixup, but I can see other issues:

>> +	unsigned long mask = 0xffffffff;	/* upper word is WI */

followed by:

>> +	mpidr = (mpidr & ~mask) | (val & mask);

is not going to preserve the top bits on 32bit (assuming we could
perform a 64bit access on 32bit, but still). Also, the mask preserves
the IRM bit, which is wrong (we don't support 1-of-n distribution).

Why don't we just have

	mpidr = val & GENMASK_ULL(23, 0);

and let's be done with it? I must be missing something about this whole
Aff3 thing...

Thanks,
