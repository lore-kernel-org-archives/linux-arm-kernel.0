Yes basically you're right.

My intent in this patch isn't to allow the user-space to map/unmap
sub-PAGE_SIZE buffers. The new test makes sure the mapped area is bigger
or equal than a host page whatever the supported page sizes.

I noticed that chunk construction, pinning and other many things are
based on PAGE_SIZE and far be it from me to change that code! I want to
keep that minimal granularity for all those computation.

However on iommu side, I would like to rely on the fact the iommu driver
is clever enough to choose the right page size and even to choose a size
that is smaller than PAGE_SIZE if this latter is not supported.

So if the user is not allowed to map sub-PAGE_SIZE buffers, accounting
still is based on PAGE_SIZE while iommu mapping can be based on
sub-PAGE_SIZE pages. I am misunderstanding something?
