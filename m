This has mostly to do with the way we export things to userspace, and
for historical reasons.

So we should either expand kvm_regs with the non-sysregs EL2 registers
and expand sys_regs with the EL2 sysregs, or we should put everything
EL2 into an EL2 array.  I feel like the first solution will fit more
nicely into the current design, but I don't have a very strong
preference.

You should look at the KVM_{GET,SET}_ONE_REG API definition and think
about how your choice will fit with this.

Marc, any preference?

Thanks,
