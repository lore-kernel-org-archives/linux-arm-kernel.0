Subject: [PATCH V5 0/4] Introduce CoreSight STM support
Message-ID: <1459997479-19431-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patchset adds support for the CoreSight STM IP block.

Changes from V4:
 - Rebased the whole patch set onto [4] (v4.6-rc1).
 - Made a few minor modifications according to the code changes since v4.5.
 - Replaced the original 1/4 with a new patch the Alex provided.
 - Another new patch 2/4 in this set is for storing path from CS-STM to sink.
 - Addressed comments from V4.
 - Removed coresight_simple_func() from CS-STM driver, used the common definition instead.
 - Modified STM tracer-id from an arbitrary value 0x20 to 0x1.
 - Replaced module_amba_driver() with builtin_amba_driver() according to [5].
 - Used driver->suppress_bind_attr to prevent CS-STM being unbound from the driver.
 - Updated the kernel version (4.7) and month in sysfs-bus-coresight-devices-stm.
 - Replaced 'mshared' with 'hw_override' in CS-STM driver.
 - Initialized sw_start and sw_end with 1.
 - Returned a size of '1' after processing FLAG packets.
 - Removed pre-compile option 'CONFIG_64BIT' for the packet size of 8.
 - Added Michael Williams's Reviewed-by in 4/4.

Changes from V3:
 - Removed ioctl get_options interface from the generic STM code and CoreSight STM driver.
 - Removed 'write_max' from the structure 'stm_drvdata', and changed 'write_64bit' to 'write_bytes'.
 - Revised stm_fundamental_data_size() to return the fundamental data size instead of 0/1.
 - Removed stm_remove() from the driver.
 - Revised the return value of ::packet() callback function according to [2].
 - Modified stm_send() to send one STP packet at a time.
 - Added comments to invariant/guaranteed CoreSight STM transaction mode.

Changes from V2:
 - Changed to return -EFAULT if failed on the command STP_GET_OPTIONS.
 - Used Alex's patch [1] instead of the last 2/6.
 - Removed the while loop from stm_send(), since the packet size passed
   to it isn't larger than 4 bytes on 32-bit system and 8 bytes on
   64-bit system.
 - Removed stm_send_64bit(), since the process of packets on 64-bit
   CS-STM should be basically the same with on 32-bit system, except the 
   maximum length of writing STM at a time.
 - Removed the support of writing 64-bit to CoreSight STM buffer at a time
   on 32-bit ARM architecture according to an ARM engineer suggestion.  As
   he said that the STM might receive a 64-bit write, or might receive a
   pair of 32-bit writes to the two addressed words in either order.
   So 64-bit write isn't guaranteed to work on the ARM 32-bit architecture.

Changes from v1:
 - Added a definition of coresight_simple_func() in CS-STM driver to
   avoid the kbuild test robot error for the time being.  This
   modification will be removed when merging the code in which the
   coresight_simple_func() has been moved to the header file.
 - Calculate the channel number according to the channel memory space size.


Thanks,
Chunyan
