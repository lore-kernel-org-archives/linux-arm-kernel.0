No, that's the encoding for ZCR_EL12.  Where did you get this from?

(This encoding follows the general pattern of the v8.1 Virtualization
Host Extensions.)

The SVE supplement is not very explicit about the meaning of bits [8:4],
but they are reserved to extend the LEN field in the future, in case
that's ever needed for future architecture revisions.  I've aimed for
Linux to cope with this.

Basically bits [8:4] are read-as-zero, write-ignore today, but in
the future some or all of them may be LEN field bits.

In particular, this means that writing all bits [8:0] with 1 will
configure the largest supported vector length, even on future
architecture versions that may have a larger LEN field.

It didn't seem useful to distinguish the two classes of bits here.
