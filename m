Ok, I'm not going to assign blame to Al's commits (I never reviewed his
stuff before they hit mainline - patches never posted to the ARM mailing
list, and the development actually happened within the merge window,
all things we tell people not to do...)  I _still_ haven't reviewed that
stuff yet.

But... nevertheless...

Ok, so this tells us the kernel was built using Thumb2 ISA.

PC is not word aligned, so it can't be running in the ARM ISA.

Note that this reconfirms the above (well, it should do, it's the same
value.)

And this tells us that we're running in ARM mode, not Thumb mode.

No stack backtrace (and it's silent about why that is).

The other strange thing here is that the stack dump above is showing that
the stack is completely empty - which shouldn't be the case if we're in a
driver probe function - driver probe functions are called via the driver
model layers...

> [    5.398664] Code: 2206a010 718ef508 0184f8da f8b1f65d (3070f8d8)

And now we come to the Code: line, which makes no sense as an ARM ISA:

   0:   2206a010        andcs   sl, r6, #16
   4:   718ef508        orrvc   pc, lr, r8, lsl #10
   8:   0184f8da        ldrdeq  pc, [r4, sl]
   c:   f8b1f65d                        ; <UNDEFINED> instruction: 0xf8b1f65d
  10:   3070f8d8        ldrsbtcc        pc, [r0], #-136 ; 0xffffff78    ; <UNPREDICTABLE>

But as Thumb, it looks more reasonable:

   0:   a010            add     r0, pc, #64     ; (adr r0, 44 <foo+0x44>)
   2:   2206            movs    r2, #6
   4:   f508 718e       add.w   r1, r8, #284    ; 0x11c
   8:   f8da 0184       ldr.w   r0, [sl, #388]  ; 0x184
   c:   f65d f8b1       bl      ffe5d172 <foo+0xffe5d172>
  10:   f8d8 3070       ldr.w   r3, [r8, #112]  ; 0x70

I don't have any further comments to make on this yet, as I've no idea
what state stuff is in, but the above oops dump to me suggests that
we've randomly jumped into some part of the kernel which just happens
to be cpsw_probe().

Please send me (in private mail) your vmlinux file and a corresponding
oops dump from that same kernel, and I'll dig and try and work out
what's going on...

This kind of investigation reminds me of those I did back in the 1990s
when stuff was rather unstable and ARM was a young architecture.  Now
all we need is for an ARM platform to dump its entire memory out the
ethernet port, bringing an university department network to a halt (I
did that once - back in the 1990s - sorry Tim!)
