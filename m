Good catch ! The error case was not hit on the system I tested, as it was
indeed having 48bit PA. I should have done more testing with Juno where it
is 40bit PA (which doesn't really allow different phys-shift ranges).

I will change the helper to extract the parange and the convert it.
Also, rename it to :

id_aa64mmfr0_phys_shift()

Cheers
