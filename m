At boot UEFI in the guest will need to make sure the areas of memory that may be
used for CPER records are reserved. Whether UEFI or Qemu decides where these are
needs deciding, (but probably not here)...

At runtime, when an error has occurred, I agree it would be simpler (fewer
components involved) if Qemu generates the CPER records. But if UEFI made the
memory choice above they need to interact and it gets complicated again. The
CPER records are defined in the UEFI spec, so I would expect UEFI to contain
code to generate/parse them.


Thanks,
