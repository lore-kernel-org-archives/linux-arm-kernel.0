What would be the idea behind it? To have separate locks for each? I
don't think that will work, as some ITS functions are called from GICv3
register handler functions which manipulate members of the distributor
structure. So I am more in favour of dropping the dist lock in these
cases before handing off execution to ITS specific functions.

Cheers,
Andre.
