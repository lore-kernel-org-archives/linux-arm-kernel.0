Subject: [PATCH v9 00/17] KVM: arm64: GICv3 ITS emulation
Message-ID: <20160713015909.28793-1-andre.przywara@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi,

this series allows those KVM guests that use an emulated GICv3 to use LPIs
as well, though in the moment this is limited to emulated PCI devices.
This is based on kvmarm/queue, which now only features the new VGIC
implementation.

Another round of changes after another round of review: some bugs fixed,
some reworks in various places. The register sanitisation has been changed
to be more readable and to add some missing masking.
The MMIO dispatching has been simplified (region type no longer in each
register description). Also the its_lock is now taken already in the
command dispatching function instead of each command handler, which
removes quite some "goto out_unlock;" and return value variables.
Also it turned out we can get rid of the special vgic_put_irq_locked()
variant. The changelog below holds a more detailed list.

You can find all of this code (and the prerequisites) in the
its-emul/v9 branch of my repository [1].
This has been briefly tested on the model and on GICv3 hardware, with
lockdep debugging enabled. If you have GICv3 capable hardware, please
test it on your setup.
Also of course any review comments are very welcome!

Cheers,
Andre.

---------------

The GICv3 ITS (Interrupt Translation Service) is a part of the
ARM GICv3 interrupt controller [3] used for implementing MSIs.
It specifies a new kind of interrupts (LPIs), which are mapped to
establish a connection between a device, its MSI payload value and
the target processor the IRQ is eventually delivered to.
In order to allow using MSIs in an ARM64 KVM guest, we emulate this
ITS widget in the kernel.
The ITS works by reading commands written by software (from the guest
in our case) into a (guest allocated) memory region and establishing
the mapping between a device, the MSI payload and the target CPU.
We parse these commands and update our internal data structures to
reflect those changes. On an MSI injection we iterate those
structures to learn the LPI number we have to inject.
For the time being we use simple lists to hold the data, this is
good enough for the small number of entries each of the components
currently have. Should this become a performance bottleneck in the
future, those can be extended to arrays or trees if needed.

Most of the code lives in a separate source file (vgic-its.c), though
there are some changes necessary in the existing VGIC files.

For the time being this series gives us the ability to use emulated
PCI devices that can use MSIs in the guest. Those have to be
triggered by letting the userland device emulation simulate the MSI
write with the KVM_SIGNAL_MSI ioctl. This will be translated into
the proper LPI by the ITS emulation and injected into the guest in
the usual way (just with a higher IRQ number).

This series is based on kvmarm/queue and can be found at the
its-emul/v8 branch of this repository [1].
For this to be used you need a GICv3 host machine (a fast model would
do), though it does not rely on any host ITS bits (neither in hardware
or software).

To test this you can use the kvmtool patches available in the "its-v6"
branch here [2].
Start a guest with: "$ lkvm run --irqchip=gicv3-its --force-pci"
and see the ITS being used for instance by the virtio devices.
