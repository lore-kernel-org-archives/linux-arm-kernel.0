Hmm, just went back and looked at my comments [1] on Suzuki's 16K page
series, and regarding our stage-2 page table configuration I wrote this:

<quote>
... the constraints of
this whole thing is, and make sure we agree on this:

1. We fix the IPA max width to 40 bits
2. We don't support systems with a PARange smaller than 40 bits (do we
   check this anywhere or document this anywhere?)
   3. We always assume we are running on a system with PARange of 40
   bits
      and we are therefore constrained to use concatination.
</quote>

So this change is actually making a bit nervous...  Marc, did you check
if all the stuff in arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_mmu.h still holds after
we relax this?

Thanks,
