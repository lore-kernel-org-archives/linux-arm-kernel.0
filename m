IIRC the plan is to get rid of ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET in the long run,
at least on ARM. Certainly for the platforms that are part of
the multiplatform support. The only platforms remaining that currently
use it are:

* gemini
* ebsa110
* ep93xx
* h720x
* rpc
* s3c24xx
* s3c64xx
* s5pc100
* shark

Most of these are actually ARMv4 based and not maintained very actively.
I'm pretty sure we can take care of ep93xx and the samsung platforms,
which are the more active of the above.
