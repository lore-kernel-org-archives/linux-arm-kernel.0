Yes, the only difference between the two is the optional signal mask
argument in ppoll.

Ok, I see.

FWIW, it should not be too hard to get an image that runs in
qemu-system-arm64.

I suppose the same problem exists on all restartable system calls
(e.g. nanosleep, select, recvmsg, clock_nanosleep, ...)?

I also believe there are various architectures that cannot see the
original system call number for a restarted syscall, in particular
when the syscall number argument is in the same register as the
return code of the syscall and gets overwritten on the way out of 
the kernel. Is this the problem you are seeing? If so, we should
find a solution that works on all such architectures.
