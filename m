Do you mean an actual function call indirected via an HVC? Similar to
what we already do today for KVM when we want to call HYP functions?

My problem here is when you say "in the physical space". Do you want to
be able to call such a function from any context? That's certainly
doable now, but I'm not completely sure of what we get.

Maybe I just don't see the use case - can you enlighten me?

Thanks,
