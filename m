Subject: [PATCH v2 04/22] PCI: fix pci_remap_iospace() remap attribute
In-Reply-To: <20170327094954.7162-1-lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>

According to the PCI local bus specifications (Revision 3.0, 3.2.5),
I/O Address space transactions are non-posted. On architectures where
I/O space is implemented through a chunk of memory mapped space mapped
to PCI address space (ie IA64/ARM/ARM64) the memory mapping for the
region backing I/O Address Space transactions determines the I/O
transactions attributes (before the transactions actually reaches the
PCI bus where it is handled according to the PCI specifications).

Current pci_remap_iospace() interface, that is used to map the PCI I/O
Address Space into virtual address space, use pgprot_device() as memory
attribute for the virtual address mapping, that in some architectures
(ie ARM64) provides non-cacheable but write bufferable mappings (ie
posted writes), which clash with the non-posted write behaviour for I/O
Address Space mandated by the PCI specifications.

Update the prot ioremap_page_range() parameter in pci_remap_iospace()
to pgprot_nonposted to ensure that the virtual mapping backing
I/O Address Space guarantee non-posted write transactions issued
when addressing I/O Address Space through the MMIO mapping.
