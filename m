right. Also I think the vgic_present can be removed since
CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD always is set when CONFIG_KVM_ARM_VGIC is set.
So overall this indeed can simply be replaced by Paolo's patch.

I did that way since CONFIG_KVM_ARM_VGIC is not selected in the config
KVM section on 32b. Currently the IRQFD select location is same for arm
and arm64.

do you prefer I select HAVE_KVM_IRQFD in the config KVM section, ie. at
the same place we select CONFIG_KVM_ARM_VGIC?

Knock on wood!

Do I need to post a v10 based on Paolo's patch?

Thanks
