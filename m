I don't see how 'categorized' is relevant. The most significant ISS bit is used
to determine if this is an IMP-DEF ESR, or one that uses the architected layout.

DFSC of zero means uncategorised. What should we do with an uncategorised SError?

We treat uncategorized as uncontainable as that's the worst thing it could be.

On aarch32 uncontainable and uncategorized even share an encoding.
(AET:00 in G7.2.43 "DFSR, Data Fault Status Register", 'state of the PE after
taking the SError interrupt exception')

Unrecoverable and Recoverable (but we don't know where it is) are both grouped
into 'can't make progress'. The comment says:
| The exception may have been imprecise.
because one of those two is imprecise.

If anyone cares which one is which, they can read the spec.

I expect this code will one day be replaced with proper kernel-first support,
its only here to avoid panic()ing due to corrected errors.


Thanks,

James
