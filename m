If the guest set FPEXC.EN to 0, then it is expecting its own VFP
accesses to trap to EL1.  If a VFP access attempt traps to EL1 and the
guest is expecting it, why does hyp need to get involved?

Hyp only needs to interfere when an otherwise untrapped access to the
VFP state would occur.

If we don't have the guest context loaded, we would still trap any
attempt by the guest to modify FPEXC to EL2 as a result of CPTR_EL2.TFP
still being set (or equivalent).
