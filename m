Oops, good spot.  Fixed.

We don't know how much free stack space there actually is until the
signal is delivered.

If the initial user stack at process startup is <8K the user process has
more serious problems than can be solved by clamping the vector length.

After process startup we are committed to some VL, and silently clamping
it at signal delivery time is a potential programmer's model / ABI break
... there would be no guaranteed way to return from the signal handler
successfully.  That may not be what you meant though ...?

In the sigaltstack() case we do know how much space there is in advance,
but@the time of a sigaltstack() call if any, we may be still be
committed to some VL.  The thread is allowed to assume the VL is
unchanged across syscalls even though the SVE register data is not
guaranteed to be preserved.

Possibly sigaltstack() should fail with ENOMEM if ss_size is too small
for the maximum VL supported by the system, but strictly speaking that
violates POSIX if ss_size >= MINSIGSTKSZ.  Also, knowing that the stack
is big enough for the kernel-generated still doesn't guarantee that
the handler's own stack needs are satisfied, so this check is of
limited use.


So, my current policy is an extension of the existing one: the stack
must have enough space for the signal frame, or attempted signal
delivery will SEGV the task -- the kernel doesn't try to work around
this in advance.

This isn't fantastic, but I haven't come up with a better answer so far.
I'm open to ideas :)

It would be cleaner, but I think it's an ABI break.  Consider a non-SVE
program that gets linked (perhaps dynamically) against a library variant
that happens to use SVE:


void segv_handler(...)
{
	/* examine signal frame FPSIMD_MAGIC to print a crash dump */
}

void f(double d, double *p)
{
	some_library_function_that_uses_sve_internally();
	*p = d;
}


segv_handler() could previously safely assume that the FPSIMD_MAGIC block
was present in the frame and may now just crash or print garbage if this
block isn't found.  But even if it does fail safe, functionality is lost
-- the crash dump cannot now include the value of d becuase the non-SVE-
aware main program doesn't know how to fish it out of the signal frame.

I would be all in favour of getting rid of FPSIMD_MAGIC in this instance
and avoiding the duplication and awkward sigreturn semantics, but I
don't see how we would get away with it without breaking existing
software.
