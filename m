Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: stop propagating DAIF flags between kernel and
 VHE's world switch
Message-ID: <20170810113021.1110-1-james.morse@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

KVM calls __kvm_vcpu_run() in a loop with interrupts masked for the
duration of the call. On a non-vhe system we HVC to EL2 and the
host DAIF flags are save/restored via the SPSR.

On a system with vhe, we branch to the EL2 code because the kernel
also runs at EL2. This means the other kernel DAIF flags propagate into
KVMs EL2 code.

The same happens in reverse, we take an exception to exit the guest
and all the flags are masked. __guest_exit() unmasks SError, and we
return with these flags through world switch and back into the host
kernel. KVM unmasks interrupts as part of its __kvm_vcpu_run(), but
debug exceptions remain disabled due to the guest exit exception,
(as does SError: today this is the only time SError is unmasked in the
kernel). The flags stay in this state until we return to userspace.

We have a __vhe_hyp_call() function that does the isb that we implicitly
have on non-vhe systems, add the DAIF save/restore here, instead of in
__sysreg_{save,restore}_host_state() which would require an extra isb()
between the hosts VBAR_EL1 being restored and DAIF being restored.

I don't like the host DAIF context being stored on the stack instead of
kvm_host_cpu_state, but this should only be a problem for returns that
don't go through __vhe_hyp_call(). That should just be hyp_panic() where we
want to change DAIF anyway.

If you want a fixes tag for this, I think its:
Fixes: b81125c791a2 ("arm64: KVM: VHE: Patch out use of HVC")


While this won't conflict with v3 of the RAS+IESB series, it will depend on
this patches behaviour: Without this patch you will have SError unmasked
on host->guest world switch, a v8.2 RAS error arriving during this window
will HYP panic, but this is already the case today for guest->host.
