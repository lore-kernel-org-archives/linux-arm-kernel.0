I managed to trigger an issue with a really old EFI implementation that
doesn't configure its interrupts as Group1, and yet tries to ACK its
interrupts using the Group1 accessor. Guess what? It is not going to work.

Commit c7fefb690661f2e38afcb8200bd318ecf38ab961 in the edk2 tree seems
to be the fix (I only assume it does, I haven't actually checked). A
recent build, as found in Debian Buster, works perfectly (tested with
both QEMU v2.12 and tip of tree).

Now, I really don't get what you're saying about Linux not getting
interrupts. How do you get to booting Linux if EFI is not making any
forward progress? Are you trying them independently?

Thanks,

	M.
