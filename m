The leaks surely exist and now we'll just add an exploitable BUG.

I think we're approaching this all wrong, actually.  The fact that x86
has this CR0.WP thing is arguably a historical accident, and the fact
that PaX uses it doesn't mean that PaX is doing it the best way for
upstream Linux.

Why don't we start at the other end and do a generic non-arch-specific
implementation: set up an mm_struct that contains an RW alias of the
relevant parts of rodata and use use_mm to access it.  (That is,
get_fs() to back up the old fs, set_fs(USER_DS),
use_mm(&rare_write_mm), do the write using copy_to_user, undo
everything.)

Then someone who cares about performance can benchmark the CR0.WP
approach against it and try to argue that it's a good idea.  This
benchmark should wait until I'm done with my PCID work, because PCID
is going to make use_mm() a whole heck of a lot faster.
