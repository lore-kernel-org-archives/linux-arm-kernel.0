Marc,
   Thanks for reply.

Not that meaning.
there are two meanings:

In short, we should not set PAN for El2 in non-VHE; If you think we should, current code does not cover all scenarios.


1. In the current mainline code it sets the PSTATE.PAN at EL2 in non-VHE. As you said,
in non-VHE, there is no user-space mapping that is present at the same time as the
hypervisor mappings, so I think it may not need to set both for EL1 and El2 in non-VHE,
but current code sets it. As you see[1], the code does not check VHE.

2. Conversely, in non-VHE, if you think we should set PAN in the EL2,
current code only sets it in the guest_exit path, do not cover all scenarios.
For example, when there is no guest, only have host, host calling 'HVC' instruction enter to El2 to do somethings,
then it will not call the guest_exit, so the PAN will not be set.
In order to handle this case, we should move it to the 'el1_sync'


ENTRY(__guest_exit)
        // x0: return code
        // x1: vcpu
        // x2-x29,lr: vcpu regs
        // vcpu x0-x1 on the stack

        add     x1, x1, #VCPU_CONTEXT

        ALTERNATIVE(nop, SET_PSTATE_PAN(1), ARM64_HAS_PAN, CONFIG_ARM64_PAN)  	[1]

        // Store the guest regs x2 and x3
        stp     x2, x3,   [x1, #CPU_XREG_OFFSET(2)]

        // Retrieve the guest regs x0-x1 from the stack
        ldp     x2, x3, [sp], #16       // x0, x1
