Eh? For any RAS error you should get a physical address in ERR<n>ADDR.

When you get an external abort due to RAS you can scan these nodes to find which
one generated the error and collect the component information.
Doing this in firmware is better because firmware knows the SoC topology, so it
can skip the nodes it knows won't be relevant to an error on this CPU.

Nit: APEI table, you mean recorded as CPER records in a buffer pointed to by a
GHES's ErrorStatusAddress. APEI tables aren't parsed post boot.

This isn't a KVM problem.

It looks like both of UEFI's 'Table 275. Memory Error Record' and 'Table 276.
Memory Error Record 2' require a physical address. You can't describe a memory
error without one.

Is this really a memory error?, or some other component, say, a virtually
indexed cache.

Linux is given CPER records describing a memory error using NOTIFY_IRQ. It
delivers BUS_MCEERR_AO to Qemu. What value does FAR_EL2 have?

Even for 'AR' from KVM, we already know Marc is against exposing EL2 registers. [0]

When is this? You can get the IPA from the si_addr and Qemu's memory layout. The
IPA goes in the CPER records allowing you to emulate firmware first.
The IPA goes in the ERR<n>ADDR register (once we have emulation support for it),
covering the kernel first case.

What's left? Neither: You can generate an external abort using DFSC=0b010000 and
set FnV to tell it you don't have a virtual stage1 address.


A better argument is that user-space needs to know if BUS_MCEERR_AR triggered by
KVM's stage2 was an instruction or data abort so it can make this the correct
flavour of Synchronous External Abort.

I agree this bit needs exposing (but only for exits due to BUS_MCEERR_AR
triggered by KVM at stage2), and maybe KVM could include a little more
information to allow the full range of external-abort ESRs to be used.

You mean FAR_ELx?

For any RAS error you should get a physical address in ERR<n>ADDR.

What component do you see this happen with?

Thanks,
