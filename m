  I think this bit are not must set by firmware if the esr_el3 does
not set this bit.

yes, it is!  sorry, I  I didn't say it clearly, it should
kvm_handle_guest_abort() exit, not kvm exit.  thank you for your
correction.

In the firmware-first RAS solution, the HPFAR_EL2 does not set in any
case, becuase it traps to EL3, not EL2.
I think we should use "AT" instruction to translation GVA to IPA
address  and write the translation result to the hpfar_el2 in the
firmware.

  James, you are right, we should set the HCR_EL2.TEA, thanks for your
suggestion. I have submitted a patch for your review.

In my previous solution, firmware will check the vttbr_el2, if the
vttbr_el2 is not zero, then firmware jump to El1. otherwise, if the
vttbr_el2 is zero, jump to EL2.  this way may not good,  set the
hcr_el2.TEA is reasonable.

  than you very much for your detailed explaination, got it.
