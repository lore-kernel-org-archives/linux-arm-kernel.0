That what I understood from this thread:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/7/25/534

At the moment the LR HW bit is set whatever the source of the IRQ I
think, HW driven or ISPENDRn driven (we only test irq->hw)

No my scenario was:
IRQ originates from a ISPENDRn. I Thought we set the physical
distributor state accordingly. pIRQ is active. vIRQ is pending. On fold
we detect the line is low and we deactivate the pIRQ. pending_latch is
still true. The vIRQ will be processed but its physical IRQ has been
deactivated.

yes I think we also need to address this to get the whole picture.
