This is not the way I read it. In vgic_its_cmd_handle_mapi:

	if (!collection) {
		collection = new_coll;
		vgic_its_init_collection(its, collection, coll_id);
	}

	itte->collection = collection;
	itte->lpi = lpi_nr;
	itte->irq = vgic_add_lpi(kvm, lpi_nr);
	update_affinity_itte(kvm, itte);

If new_coll has never been mapped, you end up with the exact situation I
described, and I don't see how you make it work without checking for
target_addr being a valid vcpu index.

Let's try it. Collections are "stored" in the collection table, which
can contain at most TableSize/EntrySize entries, which is determined by
how many pages the guest has allocated. Eventually, we'll be able to
migrate the guest, and will need to write this into the allocated
memory.

To be able to map all 2^16 collections, at 8 bytes per entry, you'd need
512kB. Linux will only allocate 64kB for example.

So to answer your question: No, this doesn't sound right at all.

Thanks,
