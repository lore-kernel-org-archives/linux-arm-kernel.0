OK. In the original series, I also aligned the pgdir section to a log2
upper bound of its size, but that is not necessary anymore with your
changes. So the original goal was to avoid reserving the alignment
padding as well as the pgdirs that end up unused

It is a lot less likely to happen now that I moved the kernel to the
start of the vmalloc area rather than right below PAGE_OFFSET. But in
general, it seems sensible to only populate entries after confirming
that they are in fact vacant.

Yes, I have added that to my v3 version of the vmalloc base move patch here

https://git.linaro.org/people/ard.biesheuvel/linux-arm.git/commitdiff/0beef2c1a6bfc90cc116a6ba1b24f2ba35e7e5f6

but I think 16k/4 levels is the only config affected when the kernel
is always in the lower half of the vmalloc area. That also implies
that the fixmap pgd is either always shared, or never, depending on
the build time config, so I could probably simplify that part
somewhat.
