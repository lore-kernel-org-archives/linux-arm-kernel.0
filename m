Nice one and seems straight forward enough.
Just curious: Were there any complaints or even users of FIQs and/or
interrupt grouping?

I take it those were regression tests with Linux guests?
Do we have any means of testing this with guests which actually use
different groups or FIQs? Does kvm-unit-tests cover this?

Did you do any tests on 32 bit? I am going to fire up something on my
Midway later today ...

Cheers,
