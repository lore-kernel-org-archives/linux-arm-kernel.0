Subject: [PATCH v4 10/13] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: forwarding control

Implements kvm_vgic_[set|unset]_forward.

Handle low-level VGIC programming: physical IRQ/guest IRQ mapping,
list register cleanup, VGIC state machine. Also interacts with
the irqchip.

Signed-off-by: Eric Auger <eric.auger@linaro.org>

---
v3 -> v4:
- use the target vCPU in set/unset_forward
- rebase after removal of vgic_irq_lr_map
- clarify set/unset_forward comments,
- host_irq renamed into irq and virt_irq (SPI ID) now used in
  place of SPI index (former guest_irq)
- replaced BUG_ON by WARN_ON
- simplify unset_forward implementation by using vgic_unqueue_irqs
- handle edge mapped unshared IRQs

v2 -> v3:
- on unforward, we do not compute & output the active state anymore.
  This means if the unforward happens while the physical IRQ is
  active, we will not VFIO mask the IRQ while deactiving it. If a
  new physical IRQ hits, the corresponding virtual IRQ might not
  be injected (hence lost) due to VGIC state machine.

bypass rfc v2:
- use irq_set_vcpu_affinity API
- use irq_set_irqchip_state instead of chip->irq_eoi

bypass rfc:
- rename kvm_arch_{set|unset}_forward into
  kvm_vgic_{set|unset}_forward. Remove __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_HALT_GUEST.
  The function is bound to be called by ARM code only.

v4 -> v5:
- fix arm64 compilation issues, ie. also defines
  __KVM_HAVE_ARCH_HALT_GUEST for arm64

v3 -> v4:
- code originally located in kvm_vfio_arm.c
- kvm_arch_vfio_{set|unset}_forward renamed into
  kvm_arch_{set|unset}_forward
- split into 2 functions (set/unset) since unset does not fail anymore
- unset can be invoked at whatever time. Extra care is taken to handle
  transition in VGIC state machine, LR cleanup, ...

v2 -> v3:
- renaming of kvm_arch_set_fwd_state into kvm_arch_vfio_set_forward
- takes a bool arg instead of kvm_fwd_irq_action enum
- removal of KVM_VFIO_IRQ_CLEANUP
- platform device check now happens here
- more precise errors returned
- irq_eoi handled externally to this patch (VGIC)
- correct enable_irq bug done twice
- reword the commit message
- correct check of platform_bus_type
- use raw_spin_lock_irqsave and check the validity of the handler
