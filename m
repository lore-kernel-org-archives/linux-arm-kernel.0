I guess I need to tweak the wording here.

TIF_SVE says where the vector state should be loaded/stored from,
but does not say whether the data is up to date in memory, or when
it should be loaded/stored.

The latter is described by a cocktail of different things including
which bit of kernel code we are executing if any, whether the task
is running/stopped etc., TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE,
task->thread.fpsimd_state.cpu and per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state).


Does this make any better sense of my code below?

See my comment above ... any better?

If so, I'll paste some of that explanatory text into fpsimd.c (in lieu
of a better place to put it).
