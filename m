I'd rather avoid runtime failure on this path, because that's pretty
terminal. Build-time is a possibility, to some extent.

I don't mind reworking this if that makes it safer. But the real problem
is that the register number and the group are not necessarily constants
(see how this is used in __vgic_v3_get_highest_active_priority).

I'll have a look at how I can make that look a bit better.
