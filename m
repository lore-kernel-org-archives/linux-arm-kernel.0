The issue is easily reproducible in QEMU as well, when building from
the same config. I tracked it down to CONFIG_NUMA=y, which sets
CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_EMBED_FIRST_CHUNK=y, affecting the placement of
the static per-CPU data (including the IRQ stack).

However, what I hadn't realised is that the first chunk is referenced
via the linear mapping, so we will need to [vm]allocate the per-CPU
IRQ stacks explicitly, and record the address in a per-CPU pointer
variable instead.

I have updated my branch accordingly.
