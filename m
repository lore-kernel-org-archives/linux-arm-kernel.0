When I reworked our code to only use a flag and not a separate routing
type I ended up with the flag only guarding assignments, which wouldn't
hurt if done unconditionally (since they are all u32's). So the whole
usage of the flag is somewhat in jeopardy now.
Either the eventual MSI consumer requires a DevID (ITS emulation, which
will not work without it) or the consumer does not care at all and can
totally ignore it (GICv2m). So I think we can always pass on the DevID
field and let the final function decide whether to use it or not. But
somehow this doesn't sound right to me, so maybe I am missing something
here?

Cheers,
Andre.
