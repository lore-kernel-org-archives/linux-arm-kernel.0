The guest may not even know about the "fully coherent system". It may
continue to issue its CMOs as before, not realising that they are not
required.

S/W should really only be used in power-management scenario. I really
cannot think of a single valid (or even safe) reason to issue a S/W
operation outside of PM, when you're guaranteed that there is only a
single CPU up and running. A guest OS cannot enforce this requirement,
so that's really always broken.

Happy to add more details when I respin this series.
