Subject: [PATCH v3 0/9] Add support for monitoring guest TLB operations
Message-ID: <20170110113856.7183-1-punit.agrawal@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi,

This is a new version of the patchset to monitor guest TLB
operations. The user interface has been re-written to incorporate
feedback from LPC'16 on the previous version - it now uses a software
PMU instead of relying on perf trace to track guest TLB operations
(Patch 6 and 7). Previous versions of the patches can be found at
[0][1][2][3].

Guest TLB operations can impact on system performance but these are
not exported as architected PMU events on arm/arm64. Instead the
architecture allows trapping of TLB operations to the hypervisor. This
patchset builds on this feature to monitor TLB operations.

To minimise the performance impact, trapping is enabled -
* on user request
* for the VM of interest

With this patchset, running 'perf' on the host can be used to monitor
the TLB operations. E.g., to monitor a VM with process id 2589 -

# perf stat -a -C 0 -e kvm/kvm_tlb_invalidate,vm=2589/ sleep 25

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

             3,386      kvm/tlb_invalidate,vm=2589/

      25.001086522 seconds time elapsed


The patches are based on v4.10-rc3 and have been tested on arm and
arm64.

Thanks,
Punit

Changes:
v2 -> v3
* Replaced perf trace monitoring with software PMU
* Re-ordered patches as a result of the above re-write

v1 -> v2

* New (Patch 6) - Add support for trapping and emulating TLB
  operations to ARM hosts
* Move common code to handle perf trace notifications to virt/kvm/arm
* Move tracepoint to include/trace/events/kvm.h
* Drop patch to introduce __tlbi helper as it is now merged
* Reorder patches

RFC v2 -> v1
* Dropped the RFC tag
* Patch 2 - Use VM thread group id for identification
* Patch 4 - Update comment for clarity
* Patch 6 - Add comment explaining switch to hype-role when VHE is enabled
* Patch 7 - Add comment to clarify struct kvm_trace_hook

RFC -> RFC v2
* Patch 4 - Rename left-over TLBI macro to __TLBI
* Patch 6 - Replace individual TLB operation emulation with
  invalidating all stage 1 TLB for the VM. TLB monitoring is expected
  to be a debug feature and performance is not critical.
