Subject: [PATCH v4 00/56] KVM: arm/arm64: Rework virtual GIC emulation
Message-ID: <1463392481-26583-1-git-send-email-andre.przywara@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi,

a new update for the new VGIC series.
A lot of fixes this time: comments fixed, clarified and updated, some
no longer needed code pieces from the old VGIC have been removed.
The MMIO dispatching has been improved to allow only the access types
that are mandatory in the spec, so 32-bit accesses only for most registers
with some additionally accessible by byte or 64-bit accesses as well.
This allows for some simplification in many handler functions.
The vgic_queue_irq_unlock() function was reworked a bit and is now used
by the set-active handler as well. The clear-active handler has been
extended to basically halt the guest and make sure we clear the respective
active bit in the LR (and not only in our structure). There is a new patch
introducing the KVM core bits of this feature.
Also we now detect when the redistributor and distributor regions overlap
and complain about it.
As this series is now based on kvmarm/next, we also gained the firmware
independent probing feature, which is in turn also used in this series.
This should enable ACPI machines.
A more detailed changelog can be found in the respective patches.

As this new VGIC emulation will probably become the default very shortly,
please test it full steam on whatever setup you have access to.
Any reports are warmly welcome.

This series is now based on kvmarm/next, which will be merged shortly into
Linus' kernel.
A git tree containing this series can be found on linux-arm.org:

Cheers,

===========================
This series is a joint effort to re-implement KVM's GIC emulation.
Many patches as in here have been effectively authored by multiple
people and authorship isn't clear in every case, especially since
many of the patches have been stashed together or splitted apart in
the process. So take the Author: tag with a grain of salt.

While the current VGIC implementation is centered around providing
efficient MMIO emulation, the hot path for most guests is actually
the guest entry and exit, which currently is rather costly.
Also the existing emulation has a global distributor lock, which
quickly becomes a bottleneck once the number of VCPUs increases.
Additionally the emulation was originally designed for GICv2, adding
GICv3 ITS emulation support to this proved to be rather painful.
Last, but not least the existing code became less and less
maintainable, with many special cases handled explicitly.

The new implementation is build around a struct vgic_irq data
structure, which holds all information about a virtual interrupt.
Interruts which should be injected are held in a per-VCPU list, this
make the entry/exit path much more efficient. Also the new structure
allows to have more fine grained locking - per IRQ and per VCPU -
getting rid of the global distributor lock.
As a result of the new design ITS emulation fits in more nicely, the
respective code will be provided as a follow-up series.

This series implements the same feature set as the existing emulation,
as a goodie we now implement priorities correctly.
To allow an easy transition with good test coverage, but still maintain
stability, both implementations live side by side, selectable via a
Kconfig option. The default is the new implementation.
If this code proves to be reliable, we will later remove the current
implementation with an extra patch set.

Please have a look at the series, review it and give the code some
serious testing (and possibly debugging). All feedback is appreciated.

Cheers,
Andre.
