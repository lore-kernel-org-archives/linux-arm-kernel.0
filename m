There is another case on struct siginfo which has some pointers and it
wouldn't look like an LP64 structure at all (and glibc doesn't normally
intercept the sighandler call to rewrite the structure). We could add
padding around void * members as the kernel zeros them, I don't recall
the kernel reading these pointers from user. Anyway, using something
that resembles compat_siginfo looked the simplest for ILP32.
