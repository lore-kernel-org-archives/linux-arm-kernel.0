So refcount_inc() and refcount_add(n, ...) will write 1 and n
respectively, then hit the handler to saturate? That seems entirely
fine to me: checking inc-from-zero is just a protection against a
possible double-free condition. It's still technically a race, but a
narrow race on a rare condition is better than being able to always
win it.

Nice!
