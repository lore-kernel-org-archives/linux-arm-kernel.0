Subject: [PATCH 3/4] arm64: arm_pmu: Exclude EL1,2 with :G :H perf attributes
In-Reply-To: <1542286549-4501-1-git-send-email-andrew.murray@arm.com>
References: <1542286549-4501-1-git-send-email-andrew.murray@arm.com>
Message-ID: <1542286549-4501-4-git-send-email-andrew.murray@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

When using VHE, EL1 is unused by the host and EL2 is unused by the
guest - therefore we can filter out these events with the PMU as per
the 'exclude_host' and 'exclude_guest' attributes.

With both VHE and non-VHE we switch the counters between host/guest
at EL2. With non-VHE when using 'exclude_host' we filter out EL2.

These changes eliminate counters counting host events on the
boundaries of guest entry/exit when using :G. However when using :H
unless exclude_hv is set on non-VHE then there is a small blackout
window at the guest entry/exit where host events are not captured.
