I don't think we need this. Exposing the ISTATUS bit to the kernel (or
even userspace) is not really a problem (that's actually an interesting
piece of information), and restoring it is not possible since it is
read-only.

We should drop the equivalent 'and' from the arm64 version.

Otherwise looks pretty good. Can you send an updated patch?
