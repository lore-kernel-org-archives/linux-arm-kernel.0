We could enable CONFIG_ARM_MODULE_PLTS in this case, and force a
branch via a PLT entry if an affected instruction is encountered.
However, this only covers branch instructions that are covered by
relocations, so we'd still need to scan the module .text to look for
affected instructions whose targets has been resolved at compile time.
