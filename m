Subject: [RFC v2][PATCH 01/11] Introduce rare_write() infrastructure
In-Reply-To: <1490811363-93944-1-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>
References: <1490811363-93944-1-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>
Message-ID: <1490811363-93944-2-git-send-email-keescook@chromium.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Several types of data storage exist in the kernel: read-write data (.data,
.bss), read-only data (.rodata), and RO-after-init. This introduces the
infrastructure for another type: write-rarely, which is intended for data
that is either only rarely modified or especially security-sensitive. The
goal is to further reduce the internal attack surface of the kernel by
making this storage read-only when "at rest". This makes it much harder
to be subverted by attackers who have a kernel-write flaw, since they
cannot directly change these memory contents.

This work is heavily based on PaX and grsecurity's pax_{open,close}_kernel
API, its __read_only annotations, its constify plugin, and the work done
to identify sensitive structures that should be moved from .data into
.rodata. This builds the initial infrastructure to support these kinds
of changes, though the API and naming has been adjusted in places for
clarity and maintainability.

Variables declared with the __wr_rare annotation will be moved to the
.rodata section if an architecture supports CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_WRITE_RARE.
To change these variables, either a single rare_write() macro can be used,
or multiple uses of __rare_write(), wrapped in a matching pair of
rare_write_begin() and rare_write_end() macros can be used. These macros
are expanded into the arch-specific functions that perform the actions
needed to write to otherwise read-only memory.

As detailed in the Kconfig help, the arch-specific helpers have several
requirements to make them sensible/safe for use by the kernel: they must
not allow non-current CPUs to write the memory area, they must run
non-preemptible to avoid accidentally leaving memory writable, and must
be inline to avoid making them desirable ROP targets for attackers.
