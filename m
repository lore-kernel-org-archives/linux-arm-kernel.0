Did you get one of the WARNs for it?

Hm, yeah,

This is what I had originally for arm64, but when I tried exercising
this code more recently, it didn't need the whitelist. It really looks
like I forgot what I had tested the first time, though. :P

Seems like it would be tripped by:

static int __fpr_get(struct task_struct *target,
                     const struct user_regset *regset,
                     unsigned int pos, unsigned int count,
                     void *kbuf, void __user *ubuf, unsigned int start_pos)
{
        struct user_fpsimd_state *uregs;

        sve_sync_to_fpsimd(target);

        uregs = &target->thread.fpsimd_state.user_fpsimd;

        return user_regset_copyout(&pos, &count, &kbuf, &ubuf, uregs,
                                   start_pos, start_pos + sizeof(*uregs));
}

And similarly __fpr_set(), compat_vfp_get(), compat_vfp_set(),
sve_get(), and sve_set(), ?

I think you're right -- I just tricked myself after looking at arm32.
