Hi Jon,

Steve is currently away, but should be back in the office next week.

I'm currently investigating an intermittent memory corruption issue in
v4.0-rc1 I'm able to trigger on Seattle with 4K pages and 48-bit VA,
which may or may not be related. Sometimes it results in a hang (when
the vectors get corrupted and the CPUs get caught in a recursive
exception loop).

Which architecture(s) are you hitting this on?

Which configurations configuration(s)?

What are you using to tickle the issue?

Thanks,
Mark.
