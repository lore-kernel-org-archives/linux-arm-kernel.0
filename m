Absolutely. I'll fold that in. Thanks.

PoC is in general stronger than PoU. All we care is for instructions to
be fetched from the point where the icache cannot be distinguished from
the dcache - the definition of the PoU. Also, I don't think there is a
way to invalidate the icache to the PoC.

The problem is that we need to factor in the interaction with the unmap
below. If we don't enforce the invalidation now, we may unmap the page
before the invalidations are finished, with could lead to a page fault.
If we didn't have to deal with highmem, that would indeed be a good
optimization.

Oops... That's indeed totally broken. Thanks for noticing it!

Thanks,
