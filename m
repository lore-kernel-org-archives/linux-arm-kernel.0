Yes. As you mentioned above, sival_int overlaps the most significant 32bit
of the sival_ptr, it seems that your patch is right if sival_ptr is less than
32bit.

Yeah, it seems that my patch is useful only if the sival_ptr is bigger
than 32bit. It need the similar changes with following catalin's patch
in the following 64bit architecture:
x86:                 arch/x86/ia32/ia32_signal.c
tile, s390:          arch/xxx/kernel/compat_signal.c
parisc, sparc, mips: arch/xxx/kernel/signal32.c
powerpc:             arch/xxx/kernel/signal_32.c

cc these maintainers for input.
