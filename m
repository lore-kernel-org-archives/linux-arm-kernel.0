It might not seen sensible, but we could still be relying on this in the
kernel and so this change would introduce a regression. I think we need
a way to identify such pointer usage before these patches can seriously be
considered for mainline inclusion. For example use of '>' and '<' to
compare pointers in an rbtree could be affected by the introduction of
tags.
