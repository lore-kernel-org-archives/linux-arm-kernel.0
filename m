It appears like there are two soft float implementations.

FastFPE - but that's missing arch/arm/fastfpe directory, the option
can still be selected but nothing is built.

And the Netwidner FPE arch/arm/nwfpe, that doesn't appear to be
hooked into the kernel. The hook nwfpe_enter is not referenced
anywhere.

I could make this change but have no way to bring the host up to
test it.
