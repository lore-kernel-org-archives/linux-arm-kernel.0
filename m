Subject: [PATCH v3 00/20] KVM: arm/arm64: Optimize arch timer register handling
Message-ID: <20170923004207.22356-1-cdall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

We currently spend a measurable amount of time on each entry/exit to the
guest dealing with arch timer registers, even when the timer is not
pending and not doing anything (on certain architectures).

We can do much better by moving the arch timer save/restore to the
vcpu_load and vcpu_put functions, but this means that if we don't read
back the timer state on every exit from the guest, then we have to be
able to start taking timer interrupts for the virtual timer in KVM and
handle that properly.

That has a number of entertaining consequences, such as having to make
sure we don't deadlock between any of the vgic code and interrupt
injection happening from an ISR.  On the plus side, being able to inject
virtual interrupts corresponding to a physical interrupt directly from
an ISR is probably a good system design change overall.

We also have to change the use of the physical vs. virtual counter in
the arm64 kernel to avoid having to save/restore the CNTVOFF_EL2
register on every return to the hypervisor.  The only reason I could
find for using the virtual counter for the kernel on systems with access
to the physical counter is to detect if firmware did not properly clear
CNTVOFF_EL2, and this change has to weighed against the existing check
(assuming I got this right).

On a non-VHE system (AMD Seattle) I have measured this to improve the
world-switch time by about ~100 cycles, but on an EL2 kernel (emulating
VHE behavior on the same hardware) this gives us around ~250 cycles
worth of improvement, and on Thunder-X we seem to get ~650 cycles
improvement, because we can avoid the extra configuration of trapping
accesses to the physical timer from EL1 on every switch.

These patches require that the GICv2 hardware (on such systems) is
properly reported by firmware to have the extra CPU interface page for
the deactivate register.

Code is also available here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cdall/linux.git timer-optimize-v3

Based on v4.14-rc1

Some recent numbers I ran on Thunder-X with v4.14-rc1 with/without these
patches (averaged over a few hundred thousand executions) for a base
hypercall cost:

Without this series, avg. cycles: 12,476
Without this series, min. cycles: 12,052

With this series, avg. cycles: 11,782
With this series, min. cycles: 11,435

Improvement ~650 cycles (over 5%)

Changes since v2:
 - Removed RFC tag
 - Included Marc's patch to support EOI/deactivate on broken firmware
   systems
 - Simplified patch 6 (was patch 5 in RFC v2)
 - Clarify percpu_devid interrupts in patch 12 (was patch 11)

Thanks,
  Christoffer
