I didn't catch this with my first review, the function will need an
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() to allow building modules. This will mean an
interface extension what should be non-arch. So, for architectures we
need the pmu name like SH we just implement the generic function. For
ARM we don't need to provide this function.

Most of the interface is defined in linux/perf_event.h. We shouldn't
move this to asm/perf_event.h, so this is one more argument for the
non-arch implementation.

As the implementation of the function would be optional, why should we
make it architectural?
