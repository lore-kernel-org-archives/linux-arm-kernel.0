No, it does not. The ERR_PTR()/IS_ERR() is a horrible pattern for code
readability because it breaks the expectations that programmers have for
what is and is not a bad pointer. There are decades of history where the
test for a bad pointer is 'if (!ptr)'. Not only does ERR_PTR make make
that test not work, but the compiler won't tell you when you get it
wrong.

There are places where ERR_PTR makes sense. Particularly when
communicating with userspace where error codes have very specific
meanings, but I don't want it in the GPIO subsystem.
