Is this document (2012) still a reference document?
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0001c/DEN0001C_principles_of_arm_memory_maps.pdf
(especially Fig 5?)

Peter, comments in QEMU hw/arm/virt.c suggested next RAM chunk should be
added at 2TB. This doc suggests to put it at 8TB. I understand the PA
memory map only is suggested but shouldn't we align?

Thanks

Eric
