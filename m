If you prefer to consider everyone who's been sleeping in the same room
at one of the Oldenburg Linux meetings as part of my household, that's
fine for me ;-)

Mine is also some patched version of 4.1.1, built from Ubuntu sources:

    gcc version 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.1-21)

These sources probably even contained the fixes to make gcc-4.1.1
usable on CELL.
