Shouldn't we use something with better diffusion than rotate and xor?
If we can afford to decompress ~10 MB worth of vmlinux, I'm sure we
can afford to crc() the device tree blob.

As mentioned by several people, this is a nice way to add
/chosen/kaslr-seed to the mix if it is there, and still have some
pseudo=entropy otherwise, especially given the fact (as Daniel figured
out) that Android puts device serials and some boot timing related
variables on the kernel command line.
