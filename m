I forgot to list this one in my summary of approaches[*]. This is a
nice, clean approach. Avoids getting cache maintenance into everything.
However, besides the difficulty to get it past mm people, it reduces
performance for any userspace-userspace uses/sharing of the memory.
userspace-guest requires cache maintenance, but nothing else. Maybe
that's not an important concern for the few emulated devices that need
it though.

I guess this is the same as the madvise approach, but with a driver.
KVM could take this approach itself when memslots are added/updated
with the INCOHERENT flag. Maybe worth some experimental patches to
find out?

I'm still thinking about experimenting with the ARM private syscalls
next though.
