For ARM, This should be called when we're about to block in a situation
where timer interrupts could affect our sleep state, which would not be
the case for vcpu_sleep, which unconditionally puts the vcpu to sleep
based on other conditions.

I believe that any case where you care about incoming interrupts are
covered by the semantics of kvm_vcpu_block, and therefore these hooks
should only be called by kvm_vcpu_block.
