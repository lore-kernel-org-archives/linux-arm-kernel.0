Why that? It allows fast and CPU local modifications of r/o memory.
OTOH, an approach that needs to fiddle with page table entries
requires global synchronization to keep the individual TLB states in
sync. Hmm.. Not that fast, I'd say.

It seems to be working fine for more than a decade now in PaX. So it
can't be such a big maintenance nightmare ;)

The "proper solution" seems to be much slower compared to just
toggling CR0.WP (which is costly in itself, already) because of the
TLB invalidation / synchronisation involved.

"Just works", sure -- but it's not as tightly focused as the PaX
solution which is CPU local, while your proposed solution is globally
visible.
