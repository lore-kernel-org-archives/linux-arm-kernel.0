We can, but it defeats an existing optimisation on the host side,
which I was trying to avoid.


The scenario is as follows:

Task A is some random user task.
Task B is a vcpu thread, which is initially not running, having been
preempted in the kernel vcpu run loop.

 * A runs in userspace
 * B preempts A
 * A's FPSIMD state is still in the CPU
 * KVM saves A's FPSIMD state in the host context for this CPU
 * KVM enters vcpu for B
 * B's vcpu exits for some reason
 * KVM restores the host FPSIMD context (= A's FPSIMD state)
 * A is scheduled
 * A returns to userspace

If we NULL the fpsimd_last_state pointer, A's FPSIMD state is now
reloaded even though it is in the CPU already.

In the SVE case this is currently necessary though, because the
(non-SVE-aware) host context save/restore done by KVM is insufficient
to ensure that the whole SVE state is preserved for A.  My initial
patch for this was broken though: this one should fix it.


I don't want to add host context save/restore for full SVE, because it
will almost always be redundant: the vcpu thread won't have any SVE
state anyway because it is in a syscall (the run ioctl()); a second
user thread has already saved its FPSIMD state during sched- out and
would restore it at ret_to_user anyway, so it is pointless for KVM
either to save or restore this context in that case.


Ideally, KVM should be aware of and make use of the host's FPSIMD/SVE
context management rather than doing its own: this would eliminate
redundant save/restore.

However, I see that as a separate optimisation and didn't want to
address it yet.

Does that make sense?
