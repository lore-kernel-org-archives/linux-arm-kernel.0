With existing kernels on ARM:

00010000-00017000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 270810     /bin/cat
00026000-00027000 r--p 00006000 08:01 270810     /bin/cat
00027000-00028000 rw-p 00007000 08:01 270810     /bin/cat
7f661000-7f679000 r-xp 00000000 08:01 281659     /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ld-2.23.so
7f688000-7f689000 r--p 00017000 08:01 281659     /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ld-2.23.so
7f689000-7f68a000 rw-p 00018000 08:01 281659     /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ld-2.23.so

If the loader is loaded at 4MB, this means the size of an ET_EXEC
program is limited to less than 4MB - and distros aren't yet
building everything as PIE on ARM.
