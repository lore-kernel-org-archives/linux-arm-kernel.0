I think I get it; I think the confusion comes from the fact that all
this depends on the non-shared forwareded interrupts must be configured
with separate deactivate and priority drop (correct?), and since this
support is not in nor is a requirement for this series, it's kind of
hard to understand.

I noticed now that you had in the cover letter that this patch wasn't
intended for merging, but I didn't before...

fair enough, I hope the caller then has a BUG_ON(mapping == NULL).
