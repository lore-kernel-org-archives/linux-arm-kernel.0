Yes. Applications which wish to mandate pointer authentication
(presumably using instructions outside of the HINT space) must check the
relevant HWCAP first.

The enabled/disabled wording is probably the confusing bit here.

At EL1 we have conditional enables for instructions using
AP{I,D}{A,B}Key, which behave as NOPs when disabled.

At EL2 we have a single conditional trap for all instructions using
pointer authentication, that traps to EL2 when instructions are not
NOP'd by EL1.

So "disabled by EL2" is actually "trapped by EL2", and "disabled by EL1"
is "NOP'd by EL1".

I think the documentation explained it poorly. Did the above help?

If disabled by EL1, the instructions behave as NOPs (regardless of the
EL2 traps).

If enabled by EL1, but trapped by EL2, the instructions trap to EL2.

If enabled by EL1, and not trapped by EL2, the instructions work as
usual.

I'll see if I can document this better.

Thanks,
Mark.
