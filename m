I was thinking in the context of ILP32 but we can address this
separately for the exported kernel headers and glibc definitions.
Looking at this structure from an LP64 perspective, it indeed makes
sense to keep it as void *. We have other UAPI structures with user
pointers already.

Thanks for the explanation, it makes sense to keep an absolute pointer
here rather than offset. So no further changes needed to this patch.
