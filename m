I'm afraid that won't be enough. If the CPU is brought up once we've
already started a VM, we're screwed, as we cannot retroactively decide
to drop GICv4 on the floor and nuke the guest. Or did you have something
more radical in mind? Panic?

Maybe this approach is not the right one, in which case I'm happy to
drop this patch and implement something else.

Thanks,
