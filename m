For example:
guest OS user space accesses device type memory, but happen SError. because the
SError is asynchronous faults, it does not take immediately. when guest OS call "SVC" to enter guest os
kernel space, the ESB instruction(Error Synchronization Barrier) will defter this SError. so the SError happen immediately.

it is indeed, non-KVM user space can not get the notification from hypervisor or host kernel. thanks for the pointing out
do you mean still Signal SIGBUS from memory_failure?

James, you mainly concern the way that "tell Qemu/kvmtool via a KVM-specific API", right?
so how about still delivered SIGBUS same as the SEA(Synchronous External Abort)?

by the way, what is your meaning of below words?

  it does not want Qemu/kvmtool to parse the ESR.
  Qemu/kvmtool can refer to the ESR to specify the vsesr's value, only for reference.

  As mentioned above, firmware does by faking an SError interrupt exception entry to EL2.
  so the esr_El2 may contain some useful information, Qemu can refer to this value to set the vsesr_el2(esr_el1).

  when qemu specified the vsesr value, do you mean not refer to the esr_el2 value?
  if so, what is the suggested value for the vsesr_el2 value?

 Yes, I agree with you.

  consider again, using the fault_ipa indeed has problem. because SEI is asynchronous faults. the IPA which is recorded in the register may not the real error address.
  thanks for the pointing out.

so do you suggest to use SIGBUS to notify Qemu/kvmtool both for the SEA/SEI?
if so, how the Qemu know the error is SEA or SEI. the siginfo_t for the SIGBUS only
include the si_code(BUS_MCEERR_A{R,O}) and si_address(host VA).

here I have a question, in the "drivers/acpi/apei/ghes.c" code, it only handle the memory section of CPER.
if the section type of CPER is processor, it will not notify user-space. so only let userspace handle the memory section is reasonable?

As shown blow, only when the section is memory section, it will call ghes_handle_memory_failure.

 450 static void ghes_do_proc(struct ghes *ghes,
 451              const struct acpi_hest_generic_status *estatus)
 452 {
 453     int sev, sec_sev;
 454     struct acpi_hest_generic_data *gdata;
 455     uuid_le sec_type;
 456     uuid_le *fru_id = &NULL_UUID_LE;
 457     char *fru_text = "";
 458
 459     sev = ghes_severity(estatus->error_severity);
 460     apei_estatus_for_each_section(estatus, gdata) {
 461         sec_sev = ghes_severity(gdata->error_severity);
 462         sec_type = *(uuid_le *)gdata->section_type;
 463
 464         if (gdata->validation_bits & CPER_SEC_VALID_FRU_ID)
 465             fru_id = (uuid_le *)gdata->fru_id;
 466         if (gdata->validation_bits & CPER_SEC_VALID_FRU_TEXT)
 467             fru_text = gdata->fru_text;
 468
 469         if (!uuid_le_cmp(sec_type,
 470                  CPER_SEC_PLATFORM_MEM)) {
 471             struct cper_sec_mem_err *mem_err;
 472
 473             mem_err = acpi_hest_generic_data_payload(gdata);

  classification step is need, for the error that Qemu/kvmtool can actually handled, what is vsesr_el2's value if qemu specify it?
  If qemu sets arbitrary value for vsesr, it may affect guest os error recovery. so here I let Qemu refer to the esr_el2's value.

 here I show a example in the   "RAS_Extension_PRD03-PRDC-010953-33-0", in this example, it even Sets up SPSR_EL1, ELR_EL1 and ESR_EL1 with copies of SPSR_EL2, ELR_EL2 and
 ESR_EL2.

Variant: asynchronous External Abort with delegated exception handling
The example above requires the hypervisor to know that it can delegate the error exception to the OS using a
virtual error interrupt. In this example:
? The error exception is taken asynchronously.
? Before the load instruction completes, the software executes an SVC instruction.
? The OS uses the ESB instruction at the SVC exception entry point. This barriers the error as described
above.
? The firmware logs, triages, and delegates the error exception to the hypervisor. As the error came
from EL1, it does by faking an SError interrupt exception entry to EL2.
? Control transfers to the hypervisor?s delegated error recovery agent. It repeats the process of triaging
the error.
? The hypervisor, however, delegates the error exception to the OS using the delegated exception
handler model.
? If it were to try a virtual SError interrupt, then this would be masked on return to EL1.
? The delegated exception handler model is described in [5], but, briefly, the hypervisor:
? Stashes the original SPSR_EL2, ELR_EL2 and ESR_EL2 in a local record.
? Stashes the current SPSR_EL1, ELR_EL1 and ESR_EL1 in a local record.
? These registers may contain live data.
? Sets up SPSR_EL1, ELR_EL1 and ESR_EL1 with copies of SPSR_EL2, ELR_EL2 and
ESR_EL2.
? That is, the syndrome for the error.
? Sets SPSR_EL2 and ELR_EL2 to point to the OS delegated error recovery agent entry point,
and executes an ERET instruction.
? Control returns to the OS. It triages the error and discovers that the error was taken from an ESB
instruction at an exception entry point and so it might be able to recover from the error.
? The OS returns from its delegated error recovery agent by executing a Hypervisor call, asking the
hypervisor to schedule a virtual SError interrupt. The hypervisor:
? Restores the original SPSR_EL2, ELR_EL2 and ESR_EL2 from its local record.
? Sets HCR_EL2.VSE to 1.
? Returns back to the OS at the point the error exception was taken from (in this case, the ESB).
? The virtual SError interrupt is processed as described above.
? The error has been logged, triaged, and contained to the EL0 application.

  James, only memory errors needs application to do additional work. UEFI spec mentioned that?
