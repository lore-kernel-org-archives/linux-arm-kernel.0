Not quite.  From the PoV of the guest, we default to rev 2 (which it
cannot differentiate from rev 1), becasue it is itself allowed to change
the groups, which it couldn't do in rev 0.

However, from the PoV of userspace...

For future changes, which are likely to be unrelated to IGROUPR, you get
rev N behavior where N is the most recent N, except that IGROUPR won't
be writable unless userspace confirms that it knows about revisions.

This is by design.  I would like to avoid having

switch (rev) {
case 2: logic2();
case 3: logic3();
case 4: logic4();
}

spread out over all uaccess writes.

Instead, I'd like for the GICD_IIDR write to fail, and let userspace
deal with things for the future.  However, the problem is that we don't
have any such logic to use right now, and therefore we have to support
the backwards compat case now.

We could introduce a separate attribute on the GIC (IGROUPR_WRITABLE)
instead, I just found it less noisy to piggy back on the GICD_IIDR.

Is that acceptable?

I don't think this is bizarre.  As it stand now, it will see rev 1
behavior, which is identical from the guest PoV to rev 2 behavior.

And I don't think there's anything in the architecture that says that a
revision change must be directly observable by the guest?

In any case, I've come up with a new proposal for some documentation and
I hope it will be more to your liking.
