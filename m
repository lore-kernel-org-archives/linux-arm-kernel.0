Subject: [PATCH v4 10/10] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Update documentation of the
 GIC devices wrt IIDR
In-Reply-To: <1531746387-7033-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
References: <1531746387-7033-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
Message-ID: <1531746387-7033-11-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Update the documentation to reflect the ordering requirements of
restoring the GICD_IIDR register before any other registers and the
effects this has on restoring the interrupt groups for an emulated GICv2
insttance.

Also remove some outdated limitations in the documentation while we're
at it.
