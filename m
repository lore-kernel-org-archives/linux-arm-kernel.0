Subject: [RFC PATCH 00/16] KVM: arm64: Initial support for SVE guests
Message-ID: <1529593060-542-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series implements basic support for allowing KVM guests to use the
Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).

The patches is based on torvalds/master f5b7769e (Revert "debugfs:
inode: debugfs_create_dir uses mode permission from parent") plus the
patches from [1].

Issues / missing features:

 * No way for userspace to determine or control the set of vector
   lengths exposed to the guest.  This needs to be fixed for
   snapshotting/migration of guests to work reliably.

   An ioctl needs to be added for this (dropped from this series
   because I consider it lower-priority than the core support).

 * No documentation update yet (I'd like to get the interfaces
   finalised before I put too much effort into writing that...)

 * Patch 14 (SVE register ioctl() access core) may be too complicated
   in its handling of backwards compatibility for the FPSIMD regs:
   It might be simpler to use nvcpu->arch.ctxt.gp_regs.fp_regs.vregs[]
   as a bounce buffer rather than trying to redirect uaccess directly
   to the appropriate locations in vcpu->sve_state.

   I'd be interested in people's comments on this.

 * kvmtool/qemu updates are needed to enable creation of SVE-enabled
   guests (to be discussed separately).


Brief notes on the patches:

 * Patches 1-4 are miscellaneous preliminary cleanups.

 * Patch 5 adds new arch vcpu init/teardown hooks due to the lack of
   an obvious place to free a vcpu's SVE state buffer.  This may want
   a rethink, because the allocation part has now ended up in
   kvm_reset_vcpu() instead of the new init hook.

 * Patches 6-12 implement the core SVE support for guests (of which
   patch 8-9 refactor the sysregs code to support conditional hiding
   of the SVE-related registers).

 * Patches 13-15 implement ioctl() access for the new SVE registers.

 * Patch 16 exposes the new functionality to userspace, allowing
   SVE-enabled vcpus to be created.


This series is somewhat tested on Arm Juno r0 and the Arm Fast Model
(with/without SVE support).  arch/arm builds, but I've not booted
it -- only some trivial refactoring in this series affects arch/arm.

Cheers
