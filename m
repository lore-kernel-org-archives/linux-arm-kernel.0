I have no strong opinion on this: maz suggested I should add this --
his concern was to make it difficult to ignore.

This is transitional: the main purpose is to circumvent bug reports from
people who find that SVE doesn't work in their guests, in the interim
before proper KVM support lands upstream.

Marc, do you still agree with this position?

Thanks -- I'll wait for Marc's response before applying.
