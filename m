James,

I understand your idea.

Below is my previous idea:
  When signalling Qemu, Qemu generate GHES ,then  Qemu/kvmtool  inject
the SEA/SEI to guest OS. For different reason, Qemu/.KVMtool injects
diferent notification type. if inject SEA/SEI/IRQ, guest OS handle the
guest SEA/SEI/IRQ. handling guest OS SEA/SEI and IRQ guest OS software
logical is  different.
for example, guest OS call API "ghes_notify_sea" when happening SEA;
call API  "ghes_notify_sei" when happening SEI.

so what is your suggested way to notify guest OS after Qemu generating the CPER?

X86 Qemu uses below method(send acpi event) to notify guest OS for
runtime modification CPER, this method should not through KVM.
            /* Send _GPE.E05 event */
            acpi_send_event(DEVICE(obj), ACPI_VMGENID_CHANGE_STATUS);

so for the notification guest OS, I think Qemu uses IOCTL to let KVM
inject error may be better.
