I didn't say a DT node per device, the DT doesn't know what PCI devices
are available (otherwise it defeats the idea of probing). But we need to
tell the OS where the host bridge is via DT.

So the guest would be told about two host bridges: one for real devices
and another for virtual devices. These can have different coherency
properties.
