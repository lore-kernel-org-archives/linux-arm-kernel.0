Here's the summary of the thread that I will add to the changelog:

---

In general if a device driver is busily using a memory region it
already informs other parts of the kernel to not touch it via
request_mem_region().  /dev/mem should honor the same safety
restriction by default.  Debugging a device driver from userspace
becomes more
difficult with this enabled.  Any application using /dev/mem or mmap
of sysfs pci resources will now need to perform the extra step of
either:

1/ Disabling the driver, for example:

  echo <device id> > /dev/bus/<parent bus>/drivers/<driver name>/unbind

2/ Rebooting with "iomem=relaxed" on the command line

3/ Recompiling with CONFIG_IO_STRICT_DEVMEM=n

Traditional users of /dev/mem like dosemu are unaffected because the
first 1MB of memory is not subject to the IO_STRICT_DEVMEM
restriction.
Legacy X configurations use /dev/mem to talk to graphics hardware, but
that functionality has since moved to kernel graphics drivers.
