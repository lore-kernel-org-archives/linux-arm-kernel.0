>From Kconfig logic and callers of set_fiq_handler(), theoretically
there is just i.MX3, but I think they never use fiq in their
audio drivers in practice already, and Mark Brown mentioned
that we could remove fiq support in the imx audio driver (don't
remember the details at the moment).

If we can prove that i.MX3 PCM FIQ support is never used, then the
intersection is empty, and all machines that use FIQ require kuser
helpers.

This may change with Daniel Thompson's patches that use the FIQ
for NMI backtrace.
