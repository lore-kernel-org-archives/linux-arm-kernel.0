As I said before. It should be fused to 1.

That works too, though I'm not sure that it's more efficient than
temporarily creating and undoing a single cpu local alias mapping similar
to the kmap_atomic mechanism in the highmem case.

Aside of that the alias mapping requires a full PGDIR entry unless you want
to get into the mess of keeping yet another identity mapping up to date.
