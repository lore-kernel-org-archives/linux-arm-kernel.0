Subject: [RFC 2/3] arm: enable 64BIT_ATOMIC(_ALIGNED)_ACCESS on LPAE enabled
 machines

 'ldrd/strd' (load/store doublewords) instructions are 64bit atomic as
long as the address is 64-bit aligned on LPAE (Large Physical Address
Extension) enabled architectures. This feature is to guarantee atomic
accesses on newly introduced 64bit wide descriptors in the translation
tables.

 Making 64BIT_ATOMIC_ACCESS true, some kernel codes to access 64bit
variables can be optimized by omitting seqlock or the mimic of it.
 Also make 64BIT_ATOMIC_ALIGNED_ACCESS true, the 64bit atomic access is
guarnteed only when the address is 64bit algined.
