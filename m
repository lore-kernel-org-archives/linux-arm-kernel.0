Sorry, that should have been

	if (id_aa64pfr0_sve(read_sanitised_ftr_reg(SYS_ID_AA64PFR0_EL1)) &&

(Disturbingly, the original does build and then hits a BUG(), because
ID_AA64PFR0_SVE happens to be defined).


With the above, are you happy for me to apply your Reviewed-by, or would
you prefer to wait for the respin?
