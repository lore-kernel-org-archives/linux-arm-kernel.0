I've had a go at this, but there's a lot of splatter.

I can add a helper el1_enable_sve() say, and call it before probing
ZCR_EL1 in the cpufeatures code.

This makes enabling SVE a side-effect of the cpufeatures code, which
I'm not that comfortable with -- it feels like something that later
refactoring could easily break.

I can also add an explicit call to el1_enable_sve() in sve_setup(),
but this only works on the boot cpu.

For secondaries, I could add something in secondary_start_kernel(),
but this looks incongruous since there's no other call to do something
similar yet.


** Suzuki, do we have any other case where the trap for a CPU feature is
turned off by the cpufeatures code?  If there's already a template for
this then I'm happy to follow it.

Otherwise, maybe it's simpler to keep it in __cpu_setup after all
since that's a common path that all CPUs pass through.

Cheers
