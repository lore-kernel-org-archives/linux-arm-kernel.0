FWIW, for the moment I've applied (2), as you suggested, to my
arm64/vmap-stack branch, adding an additional:

	sub	x0, x0, #S_FRAME_SIZE

... to the entry path.

I think it's worth trying (3) so that we consistently report these
cases, benchmarks permitting.

It's probably worth putting the fast-path check directly into the
vectors, where we currently only use 1/32 of the instruction slots
available to us.

Does this make sense to you?

I've tried to reword the log output, as below, to give this impression.

... I still need to attack the backtracing to walk across stacks.
