As a heads-up, Ard has new ARM64_PTUMP user under drivers/firmware/efi queued
up in the EFI tree, which will also need fixing up. See commit d80448ac92b72051
("efi/arm64: Add debugfs node to dump UEFI runtime page tables") [1].

Nit: please keep headers in alphabetical order.

Can we leave this name as-is? We didn't change walk_{pud,pmd,pte}, so this is
inconsistent, and we haven't reused the name.

It feels like a layering violation to have the core ptdump code call the
debugfs ptdump code. Is there some reason this has to live here?

Other than the above points, this looks good to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
