Mostly because it?s more. I like my problems self-contained, and simulating only nesting on the CPU level is less to worry about than simulating vgic switchover as well. Of course eventually with nesting you?d want a nested vgic ;).

Just give it a try - I didn?t get any timer events and couldn?t quite figure out why. Patch is attached below.
