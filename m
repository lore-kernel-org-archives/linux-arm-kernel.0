Hi James,
 Thanks for the mail.

I checked the "aarch64/exceptions/asynch/AArch64.TakeVirtualSErrorException",
you are right, the virtual SError's syndrome value can be 0 or implementation defined value, not always 0,
which is decided by the "exception.syndrome<24>".
thanks for the clarification.

Yes,
But it will have a issue,
For the target system, before taking the SError, no one can know whether its syndrome value
is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED or architecturally defined.

when the virtual SError is taken, the ESR_ELx.IDS will be updated, then we can know
whether the ESR value is impdef or architecturally defined.

It seems migration is only allowed only when target system and source system all support RAS extension, because we do not know
whether its syndrome is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED or architecturally defined.
