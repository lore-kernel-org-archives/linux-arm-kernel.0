Subject: [PATCH v2 0/4] improvements to the nmi_backtrace code

>From the version 1 cover letter:

  This patch series modifies the trigger_xxx_backtrace() NMI-based
  remote backtracing code to make it more flexible, and makes a few
  small improvements along the way.

  The motivation comes from the task isolation code, where there are
  scenarios where we want to be able to diagnose a case where some cpu
  is about to interrupt a task-isolated cpu.  It can be helpful to
  see both where the interrupting cpu is, and also an approximation
  of where the cpu that is being interrupted is.  The nmi_backtrace
  framework allows us to discover the stack of the interrupted cpu.

Version 2 of the patch series adopts the CPUIDLE_TEXT approach that I
suggested in some discussion around identifying idle cpus, and that
Peter Zijlstra endorsed.  I renumbered the patches to put the idle-test
patch last in the series (4/4) and it is the only one modified in this
version of the patch series.  (To be fair I did also change all the
S-O-B and author lines to be mellanox.com instead of ezchip.com).

I've tested that the change works as desired on tile, and build-tested
x86, arm64, and arm.  For x86 and arm64 I confirmed that the generic
cpuidle stuff as well as the architecture-specific routines are in the
new cpuidle section.  For arm I just build-tested it and made sure the
generic cpuidle routines were in the new cpuidle section, but I didn't
attempt to tease apart the tangle of platform-specific idle routines
that arm has and tag them with __cpuidle.  That might be more usefully
done by someone with arm platform experience in a follow-up patch.

v1 of the series is here:

Chris Metcalf (4):
  nmi_backtrace: add more trigger_*_cpu_backtrace() methods
  nmi_backtrace: do a local dump_stack() instead of a self-NMI
  arch/tile: adopt the new nmi_backtrace framework
  nmi_backtrace: generate one-line reports for idle cpus
