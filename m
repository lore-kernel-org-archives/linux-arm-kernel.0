Nope. There should not be a RAS-specific kvm exit type. What information do you
need to convey that doesn't apply to another user-space process?

Qemu/kvmtool will always need to generate a new RAS error from the user-space
signals they get as a result of the host handling the error. This way KVMs
user-space isn't a special case, and the user-space code is portable across
architectures.

This does mean the host kernel has to be able to handle any and all RAS errors
before they could possibly be presented to a guest. Today we only handle memory
errors. Any other error types will need adding in a way that works on all
architectures.

Again, you're passing RAS SErrors out to user-space. The SError may have nothing
to do with the guest. The host has to handle any and all RAS errors.


The only case where the guest is involved is if if the guest treads in some
poisoned memory. (You know this:)
The host has to do its RAS work first, to check this wasn't an error in the
hosts page tables and that the host really can keep running.
memory_failure() will cause the faulty memory to be unmapped from stage 2 and
signal Qemu/kvmtool.
If the guest touches the faulty memory (even from a different CPU/vcpu),
Qemu/kvmtool will get a signal.

Qemu/kvmtool should take these signals and generate any applicable RAS error
from these.

We have to use these signals so that KVM's user-space is the same as all other
user-space.

I agree impdef SError are a different case. It doesn't look like you are passing
the impdef ESR to user-space, which I think is correct.

Passing uncategorized errors like this isn't correct, these are still RAS
errors. '2.4.3 ESB and other physical errors' in [0] says its
implementation-defined whether these Uncategorized RAS errors are uncontainable,
we should assume they weren't contained, and panic(). (If the CPU wants us to do
a better job, it needs to give us some information).

I don't think there is any point generating a fake ESR.
I need to think about using KVM_EXIT_EXCEPTION, but the exit code should mean
'run this again and I'll give it an SError'.  This lets Qemu/kvmtool set its own
impdef SError or emulate a machine that doesn't generate SError.

I think this needs more discussion, do we want to let Qemu/kvmtool reset an
affected vcpu so that its effectively running in firmware and can be brought
back online again?

No, these are RAS errors, they should be handled by the kernel, not passed to
user-space, and not both.

If user-space needs to know, it will be informed via the usual way we tell
user-space about this stuff.

For a RAS error we process the CPER records, and if they describe a memory error
we send signals to user-space.

Is there another type of RAS error we need to support for the guest? We must
support this on the host first.

I don't think KVM should go calling panic(), this needs to be wrapped up the
arch's RAS code.

Why should KVM care whether it was guest EL0 or guest EL1? Something is designed
wrong if you need to behave differently here.

(as far as I can see KVMs existing use of this vcpu_mode_priv() helper is to
emulate bits of the architecture that behave/undef differently at different
exception levels)

There are two sets of off-list co-ordination? That explains something...

I'd like to try and get this series merged as it is, then we can work on the KVM
and APEI bits as separate series on top. (otherwise we still depend on getting
this merged so we can have code that depends on ARM64_HAS_RAS_EXTENSIONS).


For KVM its:
* Allowing guests to inject SError.
* Allow Qemu/kvmtool to do something if the guest trips a non-RAS SError.
* Expose enough information to allow user-space to promote SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR to
  external-abort.
* (Handle SError during world-switch)

For APEI its:
* Allow multiple sources of NMI
* Abstract the estatus cache to use for SEI/SDEI
* Increase the priority of memory_failure_queue()s work,
* Provide a way to block ret_to-user to memory_failure work is done.

(These last two are the problem Xie XiuQi found).


Thanks,

James
