The problem with user space SMP was simply a missing lock:

I also wasn't able to use your series out of the box. There are several 
places in the code that check whether a timer is enabled (for register 
save/restore for example) and without vgic we never ended up setting 
that to true.

I don't know how safe it is to set it to true regardless. It feels to me 
like someone has to put more thought into how to switch from an 
initialized user space timer state to a vgic one. For reference, my test 
patch is below:

diff --git a/virt/kvm/arm/arch_timer.c b/virt/kvm/arm/arch_timer.c
index 891a725..56a5d51 100644
--- a/virt/kvm/arm/arch_timer.c

  		return 0;

  	if (!vgic_initialized(vcpu->kvm))
  		return -ENODEV;

Once we solved that piece, I'll happily respin my user space patch.
