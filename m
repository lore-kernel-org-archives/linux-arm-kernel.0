Forgot to mention:
This series is based on an older version of kvmarm.git/next, which is
roughly the pull request that got merged into 4.6-rc0. It applies to the
current master, so I suggest people use 4.6-rc1 as a base once this is
released.

A git tree containing this series and the prerequisites can be found on
linux-arm.org:

Cheers,
Andre.
