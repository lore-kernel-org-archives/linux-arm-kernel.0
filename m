To the best of my knowledge after picking through all the uses of 
vcpu_reg, particularly in the shared 32-bit code, this does seem to be 
the only one which involves a potentially-banked register number that 
didn't originally come from an ESR read, and thus needs translation.

(unfortunately I don't have an actual test-case as it was already a 
third-hand report when I started trying to look into it).

Thanks for picking this up,
Robin.
