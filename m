Both the acpi power aggregator and the powerclamp driver are forced idle
and have some serious issues, so are safe to ignore for now.

Also, I would explicitly not include them, because forced idle might
still be interesting.

You can skip this one, that only happens when you suspend to idle.

Yeah, the alternative is making mwait_idle_with_hints an actual
function, but then we get to somehow exclude the other users like the
forced idle stuff.
