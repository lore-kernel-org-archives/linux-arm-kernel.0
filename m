Right, that's a challenge I clearly didn't foresee.

Shouldn't it have the same semantics as the KVM calling function thing
where it pushes the LR on the stack?  But of course, that requires
having a stack for each runtime that owns hyp mode at any given time.
Potentially not great.

If possible, the idea would be that you'd call functions, just like you
normally do, but the functions you call can choose to never return -
again just like a C function can do if it messes with your machine
configuration.

But maybe the idea is fundamentally flawed, if the only function
you'd ever call from the hyp stub is one that takes over the hyp world,
and then the original design was just based on using set_vectors.  Hmmm.

Interesting.  I didn't think that we'd necessarily get rid of
set_vectors, but I agree with you that if we wanted to do this, it
should probably go.

There are two things I like about it.  First, it gets rid of the
'additional runtime' in hyp and second the changes to
cpu_init_hyp_mode() are quite nice, imho.

Thanks being said, this series is pretty nice as it is, so I don't want
to impose more work on you at the moment, so maybe we save your patch
snipped below for later if we want to consider looking at it some other
time?

Thanks,
