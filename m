Will, Catalin, could you chime in either way?

I'd previously asked for lower-case for consistency with our other
assembly macros.

Assuming I've followed the code correctly, we currently have:

stack		size		alignment (minimum)
---------------------------------------------------
task		THREAD_SIZE	THREAD_ALIGN
irq		THREAD_SIZE	16
overflow	SZ_4K		16
sdei_normal	THREAD_SIZE	THREAD_ALIGN
sdei_critical	THREAD_SIZE	THREAD_ALIGN

... since IRQ_STACK_SIZE is defined as THREAD_SIZE, and SDEI_STACK_SIZE
is defined as IRQ_STACK_SIZE.

So we can't just mask the sp, unfortunately.

It looks like we could build a get_stack_info() as they have.

We could probably clean up our stack traced atop of that, too.

Thanks,
Mark.
