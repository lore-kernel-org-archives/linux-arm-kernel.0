Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here are the changes for KVM/ARM for v4.14.

The changes are mostly bug fixes which are cc'ed stable.

We also have some minor cleanups and improvements, including added
support for migrating the active priority of interrupts when running a
GICv2 guest on a GICv3 host.

Sorry about arriving with these rather late.

The following changes since commit 5771a8c08880cdca3bfb4a3fc6d309d6bba20877:

  Linux v4.13-rc1 (2017-07-15 15:22:10 -0700)

are available in the git repository at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm.git tags/kvm-arm-for-v4.14
