  arm/arm64: KVM: Fix disabled distributor operation (2015-10-20 18:09:13 +0200)

Sorry for sending these relatively late, but we had a situation where we
found one breakage in the timer implementation changes merged for 4.3,
then fixing that issue revealed another bug, and then that happened
again, and now we have something that looks stable.

Description of the fixes is in the tag and quoted below.

Thanks,
-Christoffer

----------------------------------------------------------------
A late round of KVM/ARM fixes for v4.3-rc7, fixing:
 - A bug where level-triggered interrupts lowered from userspace
   are still routed to the guest
 - A memory leak an a failed initialization path
 - A build error under certain configurations
 - Several timer bugs introduced with moving the timer to the active
   state handling instead of the masking trick.
