There is a small, but important difference here. Your earlier suggestion
had the implication that we should check for the irq->irq_lock on all
code paths, as there is no point in only checking it in a single
function. That assertion must be true in a lot of places in the vgic
code, including places that are on the fast path.

This would turn the code into a pretty horrible mess, and bring very
little to the table (unless you consider slowing down your system to be
a feature). Also, we have better ways of detecting locking issues, such
as lockdep.

On the other hand, the BUG you quote above check for a condition that
only makes sense in this particular function.

So I'd suggest that instead of blindly counting the number of assertion,
you look at whether that makes sense at that particular point. Yes, we
probably have too many BUG_ONs, and we usually weed them after gaining
some confidence that the code is sane. For new code, a BUG_ON is a very
reassuring point that we don't hit anything unexpected.

Thanks,
