I would imagine that the chance that a restart will fail anyway when
restoring an MMU process on a non-MMU kernel. However, as you suggest,
the other way around should be possible. Thanks for clearing that up.

Specifically, do you know the meaning of the end_brk field on the
mm_context_t struct and if I need to checkpoint it on restart for
non-MMU systems (and potentially do something more clever during
restart on an MMU kernel?)
