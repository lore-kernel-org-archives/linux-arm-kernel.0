Subject: [PATCH v6 00/12] KVM Guest Debug support for arm64
Message-ID: <1434716630-18260-1-git-send-email-alex.bennee@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Here is V6 of the KVM Guest Debug support for arm64.

The changes are even more minimal than the last round which is
hopefully a good indication the series is ready for merging:

  API/ABI Changes:
    - returned to using u64 for control registers
    - renamed KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW_BP->KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW

  Keeping the control registers as 64 bit simplifies a lot of the code
  especially around sys_regs code which is used for trap and emulate
  as well as the GET/SET_ONE_REG interface which treats everything as
  a 64 bit register. Hints have also been dropped that the
  architecture could possibly expand the register one day and this
  makes the ABI future proof against that.

  The ioctl flag re-name was to make it clear that we are setting both
  HW breakpoints and watchpoints.

  Code Changes:
    - Fix endian issues trapped aarch32 debug regs
    - Changes due to control regs -> 64 bit
      - Simplification of the sys_regs
      - Simpler save/restore macro for hyp.S
      - Tracing fixes for new register size

The rest of the changes cover whitespace, spelling, and re-wording of
some of the comments. I've also added some more r-b and s-o-b tags
from the last round of review.

For full details see the changelog on each of the patches.
