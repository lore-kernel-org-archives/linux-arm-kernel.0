I can work on that. (Actually I already had put this on my TODO when I
saw this series. Your interest in it just bumped it up in priority :-)

I have a simple IPI test written for kvm-unit-tests already[*], but it's
been laying around for a while. I can dust it off and make a self-IPI
test out of it yet today though. I've been hesitating to post any gic
related stuff to kvm-unit-tests, because I know Andre has been looking
into it (and he has the gic expertise to do it more cleanly than I). I'll
go ahead and post my little thing now though, as he can always review it
and/or clean it up later :-)
