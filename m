(Sticking my oar in because this would apply to HWCAP_SVE too.)

It would have been a good idea I guess, but historically arm, arm64, x86
(for the one HWCAP2_* flag I can find) and unicore32 don't do this.
That can't change now without an API break, and changing the naming
scheme just for new hwcaps just seems messy.

Including multiple arches' headers in the same compilation unit isn't
guaranteed to work sensibly at all AFAICT -- it seems best no to rely
on it.

In the above, you could be doing something like

#ifdef HWCAP_APIA
#if HWCAP_APIA != (1 << 16)
#error "HWCAP_APIA value mismatch"
#else
#undef HWCAP_APIA
#endif
#endif

#define HWCAP_APIA (1 << 16)

...or...

#define HWCAP_ARM64_APIA (1 << 16)

(i.e., unconditionally, and with a well-behaved compile-time error if
there is a definition already).

[...]
