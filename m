I have no idea why you think this is a problem specific to aarch64-ilp32:
If we want to be able to debug 64-bit tasks from a 32-bit task on any
architecture that has compat mode, we should solve it once and
extend the ptrace interface to allow it on *all* of them. We certainly
don't need /more/ special cases for the x32 hack, there should really
be fewer of them.
