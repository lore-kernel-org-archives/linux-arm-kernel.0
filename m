Today the userspace just conveys the information from source kernel to
destination kernel through the IIDR value. This allows the destination
kernel to know what was the table layout used during the migration.

If we report the source ABI revision value on the destination, what is
the strategy we should adopt:
- limit the features to those that will be migratable through this ABI
- allow the functionalities (GICv4 for instance) but reject save?

Thanks
