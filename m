Yup, definitely worth fixing.

I'm not too worried about that, as we only have a single CPU performing
the teardown. But better safe than sorry, so I'll take it anyway.

Yes, together with the 52bit PA madness.

Hmmm, that's a good point. Kristina, what do you think?

Nice one! I've reproduced it on a model. It turns out that we only
mandate a 4kB alignment for the idmap, whilst we assume page alignment
everywhere in the code... Not great. I've fixed it as such:
