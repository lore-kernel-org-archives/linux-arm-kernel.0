There is no answer to this. How the CPU decides is specific to the CPU design.
How Qemu decides is going to be specific to the machine it emulates.

My understanding is there is some overlap for which RAS errors are reported as
synchronous external abort, and which use SError. (Obviously the imprecise ones
are all SError). Which one the CPU uses depends on how the CPU is designed.

When you take an SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR from KVM, its because KVM can't complete a
stage2 fault because the page is marked with PG_poisoned. These started out as a
synchronous exception, but you could still report these with SError.

We don't have a way to signal user-space about imprecise exceptions, this isn't
a KVM specific problem.

If ghes_notify_sei() fails to claim the error, we should drop through to
kernel-first-handling. We don't have that yet, just the stub that ignores errors
where we can make progress.

If neither firmware-first nor kernel-first claim a RAS error, we're in trouble.
I'd like to panic() as we got a RAS notification but no description of the
error. We can't do this until we have kernel-first support, hence that stub.

I agree, but I think we should fix this first before we add another user of this
unmigratable hypervisor state.

(I recall someone saying migration is needed for any new KVM/cpu features, but I
can't find the thread)

I'm against telling user space RAS errors ever happened, only the final
user-visible error when the kernel can't fix it.

This is inventing something new for RAS errors not claimed by firmware-first.
If we have kernel-first too, this will never happen. (unless your system is
losing the error description).


Your system has firmware-first, why isn't it claiming the notification?
If its not finding CPER records written by firmware, check firmware and the UEFI
memory map agree on the attributes to be used when read/writing that area.
