Hello,

Are any mm maintainers willing to take the first patch from this
series into their tree for merging into 3.18?
  mm: Introduce a general RCU get_user_pages_fast.

(or please let me know if there are any issues with the patch that
need addressing).

As Will has stated, Catalin's already acked the arm64 patches, and
these can also go in via an mm tree if that makes things easier:
  arm64: mm: Enable HAVE_RCU_TABLE_FREE logic
  arm64: mm: Enable RCU fast_gup

Thanks,

Steve
