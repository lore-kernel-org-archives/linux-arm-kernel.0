machine type is more appropriate, going by the existing users.

AFAIT, PARange tells you the maximum (I)Physcial Address that can be handled
by the CPU. But your IPA limit tells you where the guest RAM is placed.
So they need not be the same. e.g, on Juno, A57's have a PARange of 42 if I am
not wrong (but definitely > 40), while A53's have it at 40 and the system RAM
is at 40bits.

So, if we were to only use the A57s on Juno, we could run a KVM instance with 42
bits IPA or anything lower. So, PARange can be inferred as the maximum limit
of the CPU's capability while the IPA is where the RAM is placed for a given
system.
One could keep them in sync for a VM by emulating, but then nobody
uses the PARange, except the KVM. The other problem with capping PARange in the VM
to IPA is restricting the IPA size of a nested VM. So, I don't think this is
really beneficial.
