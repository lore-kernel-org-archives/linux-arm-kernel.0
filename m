Guests boot. I used an 8 vcpu, 14G memory guest; compiled the kernel 4
times inside the guest for each host kernel; base and mair. I dropped
the time from the first run of each set, and captured the other 3.
Command line used below. Time is from the
  Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss):
output of /usr/bin/time - the host's wall clock.

  /usr/bin/time --verbose ssh $VM 'cd kernel && make -s clean && make -s -j8'

Results:
base: 3:06.11 3:07.00 3:10.93
mair: 3:08.47 3:06.75 3:04.76

So looks like the 3 orders of magnitude greater number of traps
(only to el2) don't impact kernel compiles.

Then I thought I'd be able to quick measure the number of cycles
a trap to el2 takes with this kvm-unit-tests test

int main(void)
{
	unsigned long start, end;
	unsigned int sctlr;

	asm volatile(
	"	mrs %0, sctlr_el1\n"
	"	msr pmcr_el0, %1\n"
	: "=&r" (sctlr) : "r" (5));

	asm volatile(
	"	mrs %0, pmccntr_el0\n"
	"	msr sctlr_el1, %2\n"
	"	mrs %1, pmccntr_el0\n"
	: "=&r" (start), "=&r" (end) : "r" (sctlr));

	printf("%llx\n", end - start);
	return 0;
}

after applying this patch to kvm

diff --git a/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp.S b/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp.S

But I get zero for the cycle count. Not sure what I'm missing.
