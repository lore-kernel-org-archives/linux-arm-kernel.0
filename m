This phy driver is binded with the Rockchip DisplayPort
driver, here are the brief properties:
	edp_phy: edp-phy at ff770274 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dp-phy";
		rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
		clocks = <&cru SCLK_EDP_24M>;
		clock-names = "24m";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
	};

Changes in v5:
- Split binding doc's from driver changes. (Rob)
- Update the rockchip,grf explain in document, and correct the clock required
  elemets in document. (Rob & Heiko)

Changes in v4: None
Changes in v3: None
Changes in v2: None

+Rockchip Soc Seroes Display Port PHY
+------------------------------------
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible : should be one of the following supported values:
+	 - "rockchip.rk3288-dp-phy"
+- clocks: from common clock binding: handle to dp clock.
+	of memory mapped region.
+- clock-names: from common clock binding:
+	Required elements: "24m"
+- rockchip,grf: phandle to the syscon managing the "general register files"
+- #phy-cells : from the generic PHY bindings, must be 0;
+
+Example:
+
+edp_phy: edp-phy at ff770274 {
+	compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dp-phy";
+	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
+	clocks = <&cru SCLK_EDP_24M>;
+	clock-names = "24m";
+	#phy-cells = <0>;
+};
