There are a few overlapping confusions.

ldr= will do the right thing *if* the target symbol's type is correctly
annotated.  This means that ldr =some_local_code_symbol does the right
thing for branch target addresses if and only if some_local_code_symbol
is marked with .type %function (or ENDPROC).

The fact that a symbol is in a code section is *not* enough.

For ARM code this never mattered, so local symbols in .S files are
probably under-annotated in general.  BSYM() might have been used to
work around this in some cases.

We should check that all the BSYMs removed by this series from ldr=
and .long/.word etc. point to a correctly annotated symbol, and add
the annotations if not.
