Hi Pranavkumar,

Freescale has the same, or very similar, need, so any solution in this
space will need to work for both ARM and powerpc.  I'm not a big fan of
this approach as it seems to require the user to configure MSI/X via
ioctl and then call a separate ioctl mapping the doorbells.  That's more
code for the user, more code to get wrong and potentially a gap between
configuring MSI/X and enabling mappings where we could see IOMMU faults.

If we know that doorbell mappings are required, why can't we set aside a
bank of IOVA space and have them mapped automatically as MSI/X is being
configured?  Then the user's need for special knowledge and handling of
this case is limited to setup.  The IOVA space will be mapped and used
as needed, we only need the user to specify the IOVA space reserved for
this.  Thanks,

Alex
