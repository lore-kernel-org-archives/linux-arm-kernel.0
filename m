It's not immediately clear what's meant by "changing the way we invoke
create_mapping_late()" here.

It's probably worth explicitly mentioning that we need to add another
caller of create_mapping_late(), and this saves us adding (overly
strong) TLB maintenance to all callers.

It feels  a little odd to have the maintenance here given we still call
this *create*_mapping_late.

Given the only users of this are changing permissions, perhaps we should
rename this to change_mapping_prot(), or something like that?

Otherwise, this looks fine to me, and boots fine. Either way:
