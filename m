Oh right, endianness. Thanks for pointing that out!

Right, that nasty case came to me as well after sending the patches.
I had something like "gfn += ...." plus a comment in mind, but that's
purely cosmetical.

So do you want me to send out another version with those fixes (and
possibly the usage of vgic_get_irq_kref() above)?

Are there more comments?

Cheers,
Andre.
