I note that in arch/arm we have pmd_thp_or_huge() for this in
arch/arm/include/asm/pgtable-{2,3}level.h.

If we're going to rename this, it's probably best to align on that name,
which will also avoid and confusion as to the difference between
pmd_huge and huge_pmd.

Similarly, it might best live in pgtable.h if it isn't KVM-specific.

Thanks,
Mark.
