Subject: [PATCH 4/5] gic: dont disable INT in ack callback
In-Reply-To: <1264620749-24527-1-git-send-email-adharmap@codeaurora.org>
References: <1264620749-24527-1-git-send-email-adharmap@codeaurora.org>
Message-ID: <1264620749-24527-5-git-send-email-adharmap@codeaurora.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Abhijeet Dharmapurikar <adharmap@quicinc.com>

Unless gic_ack_irq is called from __do_IRQ, interrupt should not
be disabled in the ack function. Disabling the interrupt causes
handle_edge_irq to never enable it again.
