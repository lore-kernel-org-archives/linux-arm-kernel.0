Just some minor comments on this (after taking ages to realise you were
using tpidr_el0 as a temporary rather than tpidr_el1 and getting totally
confused!).

Can you use raw_cpu_ptr here, like you do for the irq stack?

I find the "return false" clause in this function makes it fiddly to
read because it's really predicating all following conditionals on current
&& !preemptible, but I haven't got any better ideas :(

The comment here is a bit confusing, since the sp has already been
decremented for the frame, as mention in a later comment.

Why not just a b without the ASM_BUG?
