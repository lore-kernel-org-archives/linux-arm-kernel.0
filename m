I'm actually going to NAK this one. This is a hot path. Having a O(1)
lookup from gpio number to gpio desc is important. I know you want to be
rid of the gpio_desc table entirely, but in this case I think it is
warranted. However, you can change the gpio_desc table to be a table of
pointers to gpio_descs instead of a table of gpio_descs. That would save
a lot of memory since unused GPIOs wouldn't have gpio_descs associated
with them. It is also the mechanism used by the IRQ subsystem.

So, it makes sense for the primary gpio_chip lookup to be the list, but
the table needs to stick around as a secondary lookup.
