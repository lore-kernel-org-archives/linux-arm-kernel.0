I have some personal opinion, if you think it is not right, hope you can point out.

Synchronous External Abort and SError Interrupt are hardware exception(hardware concept), which is independent of software notification,
in armv8 without RAS, the two concepts already exist. In the APEI spec, in order to better describe the two exceptions, so use SEA and SEI notification to stand for them.

SEA notification stands for Synchronous External Abort, so may be it is not only a notification, it also stands for a hardware error type.
SEI notification stands for SError Interrupt, so may be it is not only a notification, it also stands for a hardware error type.

In the OS, it has different handling flow to the two exception(two notification):
when the guest OS running, if the hardware generates a Synchronous External Abort, we told the guest OS this error is SError Interrupt instead of Synchronous External Abort.
guest OS uses SEI notification handling flow to deal with it, I am not sure whether it will have problem, because the true hardware exception is Synchronous External Abort,
but software treats it as SError interrupt to handle.

In the mainline code, it does not have SEI notification support, the reason I think it is because of the error address record by firmware is not accurate(SError Interrupt is asynchronous exception).
so if treat a hardware Synchronous External Abort as SError interrupt(SEI). The default OS behavior for SEI is PANIC, that is to say, when hardware triggers a Synchronous External Abort(SEA), if guest
treat it as SError interrupt(SEI), the OS will be panic. in fact, it can be recoverable instead of Panic.

I ever added a patch to support the SEI notification, but not sure whether it is can be accepted by open source, until now, not receive response.
