Yes, cred_guard_mutex looks like an obvious choice... Hmm, but somehow
initially I thought that the fix won't be simple. Not sure why.

Yes, at least this should close the race with suid-exec. And there are no
other users. Except apparmor, and I hope you will check it because I simply
do not know what it does ;)

Not sure I understand you, could you clarify?

But I was also worried that task_no_new_privs(current) is no longer stable
inside the syscall paths, perhaps this is what you meant? However I do not
see something bad here... And this has nothing to do with the race above.



Also. Even ignoring no_new_privs, SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC is not atomic
and we can do nothing with this fact (unless it try to freeze the thread
group somehow), perhaps it makes sense to document this somehow.

I mean, suppose you want to ensure write-to-file is not possible, so you
do seccomp(SECCOMP_FILTER_FLAG_TSYNC, nack_write_to_file_filter). You can't
assume that this has effect right after seccomp() returns, this can obviously
race with a sub-thread which has already entered sys_write().

Once again, I am not arguing, just I think it makes sense to at least mention
the limitations during the discussion.

Oleg.
