Subject: [RFC v5 04/13] KVM: kvm-vfio: User API for IRQ forwarding
In-Reply-To: <1426776951-24901-1-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
References: <1426776951-24901-1-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <1426776951-24901-5-git-send-email-eric.auger@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patch adds and documents a new KVM_DEV_VFIO_DEVICE group
and 2 device attributes: KVM_DEV_VFIO_DEVICE_FORWARD_IRQ,
KVM_DEV_VFIO_DEVICE_UNFORWARD_IRQ. The purpose is to be able
to set a VFIO device IRQ as forwarded or not forwarded.
the command takes as argument a handle to a new struct named
kvm_vfio_dev_irq.

---

v3 -> v4:
- rename kvm_arch_forwarded_irq into kvm_vfio_dev_irq
- some rewording in commit message
- document forwarding restrictions and remove unforwarding ones

v2 -> v3:
- rework vfio kvm device documentation
- reword commit message and title
- add subindex in kvm_arch_forwarded_irq to be closer to VFIO API
- forwarding state can only be changed with VFIO IRQ signaling is off

v1 -> v2:
- struct kvm_arch_forwarded_irq moved from arch/arm/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
  to include/uapi/linux/kvm.h
  also irq_index renamed into index and guest_irq renamed into gsi
- ASSIGN/DEASSIGN renamed into FORWARD/UNFORWARD
