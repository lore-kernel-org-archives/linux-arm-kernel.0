I've stopped reviewing after patch 12, as there is way too many design
issues. What I really want to see in the next drop:

1) Locking. The current implementation is too complicated, has holes,
and this leads to interesting bugs.
2) Split between vgic_irq and ITEs. They are not the same, and your
design explodes in the face of multiple ITSs.
3) Handling of collections is extremely creative, and doesn't remotely
match my reading of the architecture.

There is also all kind of buglets all over the shop, which can be
swiftly addressed, but the above three points are real blockers for me.

Thanks,

	M.
