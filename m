Rajendra Nayak <rnayak@codeaurora.org> helped me with testing these
patches on 4.16 kernel (with all the dependent patches already part of
4.16) on SDM845.

In addition to kernel boot up, he executed my test-code which was
stressing ioremap framework and was able to reproduce the bug without
these patches (and Will Deacon's WA).

That passed 10hrs of run.

[36001.446355] IOREMAP_TEST: my tests ended now

Thanks Rajendra Nayak  for testing these patches.
