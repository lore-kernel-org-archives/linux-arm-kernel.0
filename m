Subject: [PATCH v4 07/12] ARM: dts: r8a7740: Remove CMT renesas,channels-mask

To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Magnus Damm <damm+renesas@opensource.se>

Update the DTS to remove the now deprecated "renesas,channels-mask"
property.

The channel information is now kept in the device driver and can easily
be determined based on the compat string.
