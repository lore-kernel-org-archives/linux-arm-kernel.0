Subject: [PATCH] arm64: neon: Add preemption protection for kernel_neon_busy
Message-ID: <1531125935-19999-1-git-send-email-yandong77520@gmail.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Yandong Zhao <yandong77520@gmail.com>

may_use_simd() can be called in any case and access kernel_neon_busy,
for example: BUG_ON(!may_use_simd()).  This patch ensures that
migration will not occur during program access to kernel_neon_busy.
