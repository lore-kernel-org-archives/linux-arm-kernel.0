Generic unistd.h has this:

#ifdef __SYSCALL_COMPAT
#define __SC_COMP_3264(_nr, _32, _64, _comp) __SYSCALL(_nr, _comp)
#else
#define __SC_COMP_3264(_nr, _32, _64, _comp) __SC_3264(_nr, _32, _64)
#endif

#define __NR3264_mmap 222
__SC_3264(__NR3264_mmap, sys_mmap2, sys_mmap)


#if __BITS_PER_LONG == 64 && !defined(__SYSCALL_COMPAT)
#define __NR_mmap __NR3264_mmap
#else
#define __NR_mmap2 __NR3264_mmap
#endif

So by default we get __NR_mmap2 and sys_mmap2 on 32-bit ABIs, but
__NR_mmap and sys_mmap on 64-bit ABIs, as it should be.

The problem is that arch/arm64/kernel/sys_ilp32.c now overrides
this to use __NR_mmap2 with sys_mmap, so we have a mismatch. I think
we should either override both the implementation and the number,
or neither of them.

I think what happened is that you chose to override sys_mmap because
sys_mmap2 sometimes takes an off_t argument, however the kernel
just treats it as 'unsigned long', with a range of 44 bits for the
offset. Using sys_mmap with a __kernel_loff_t argument gives
us 64-bit range, but if we do that, I think it should be __NR_mmap.
