Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Avoid attempting to load timer vgic state
 without a vgic
Message-ID: <1511973009-56442-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The timer optimization patches inadvertendly changed the logic to always
load the timer state as if we have a vgic, even if we don't have a vgic.

Fix this by doing the usual irqchip_in_kernel() check and call the
appropriate load function.

I'm aware that this looks slightly ugly following the no_vgic label, but
this code is about to disappear with the vcpu_load/vcpu_put series, so
it's just a fix for the current version.
