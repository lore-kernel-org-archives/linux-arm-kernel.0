Just for the record, following our private email exchanges: when
executing an EFI runtime service, an interrupt comes in and Linux
disables TTBR0 accesses. When returning from interrupt, the kernel
restores TTBR0_EL1 with the value in current thread_info which is
different from the efi_mm one.

Two potential solutions:

1. Temporarily update the current thread_info ttbr0 during EFI runtime
   services (preemption is disabled). Suggested by Ard

2. Go back to per-CPU saving of TTBR0_EL1 as in v1

I'll implement 1 on Monday and give it a try.
