Not really, or at least not as long as we only support PCI. It would
have to be that although you have a GICv4 system, you end-up with an MSI
that is assigned to a GICv2m on the physical side. This cannot happen,
by definition.

So we're actually left with the platform case. An easy way to filter
things would be to look at the routing entry flags, and see if we have a
DEVID there. That would guarantee us that this is an LPI.

Yes, this is a leftover from previous revision of the architecture. That
bit used to be the Group configuration, with only group-1 being valid...
It got turned into a RES1 at a later time.
