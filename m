Fair enough -- come to think of it I've already converted some other
instances of this at Ard's request.

Having a WARN_ON() here may be a decent way to sanity-check that we
don't ever have sve_state NULL with TIF_SVE set.  This is a lot more
economical than putting a WARN_ON() at each dereference of sve_state
(of which there are quite a few).  sve_free() is also a slow path.

Currently, there are two callsites: sve_set_vector_length(), where we
test_and_clear_tsk_thread_flags(task, TIF_SVE) before calling sve_free();
and fpsimd_release_thread() where we "don't care" because the thread
is dying.

Looking more closely though, is the release_thread() path preemptible?
I can't see anything in the scheduler core to ensure this, nor any
general reason why it should be needed.

In which case preemption during thread exit after sve_free() could
result in a NULL deference in fpsimd_thread_switch().


So, I think my favoured approach is:

sve_release_thread()
{
	local_bh_disable();
	fpsimd_flush_task_state(current);
	clear_thread_flag(TIF_SVE);
	local_bh_enable();

	sve_free();
}

The local_bh stuff is cumbersome here, and could be replaced with
barrier()s to force the order of fpsimd_flusk_task_state() versus
clearing TIF_SVE.  Or should the barrier really be in
fpsimd_flush_task_state()?  Disabling softirqs avoids the need to answer
such questions...


Then:

sve_free(task)
{
	WARN_ON(test_thread_flag(TIF_SVE));

	barrier();
	kfree(task->thread.sve_state);
	tash->thread.sve_state = NULL;
}

I'm assuming here that kfree() can't be called safely from atomic
context, but this is unclear.  I would expect to be able to free
GFP_ATOMIC memory from atomic context (though sve_statue is GFP_KERNEL,
so dunno).

Could do.  I feel that the current placement of the TIF_SVE clearing in
sve_set_vector_length() feels "more natural", but this is a pretty
flimsy argument.  How strongly do you feel about this?

OK, thanks for checking it.
