I'm clearly not explaining things well enough. I shouldn't say
"corruption", I should say "malicious manipulation". The methodology
of attacks against the stack are quite different from the other kinds
of attacks like use-after-free, heap overflow, etc. Being able to
exhaust the kernel stack (either due to deep recursion or unbounded
alloca()) means attackers can control a write to addr_limit, and then
leverage that into an actual arbitrary write via subsequent calls to
copy_to_user() pointed at kernel memory. This isn't theoretical, this
is how those attacks are performed. It may sound crazy, but it's real.

With thread_info off the stack, the whole problem goes away. It's
wonderful that this has happened for x86, arm64, and s390. There are
always going to be new methods of attack for everything, but while we
slowly address the design weakness (set_fs()), we can fix the low
hanging fruit too.
