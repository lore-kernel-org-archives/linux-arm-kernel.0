Yes, you're right. We will have a pgd-level block map in that case.
This should work transparently as PMD at stage2 is folded into PGD and
we endup marking the PGD entry as huge and the stage2 accessors deal
with it appropriately. This is similar to having a PMD huge page with
64K + 42bit VA (2 level page table) on stage1.

We don't prevent this. We have a guaranteed minimum number of levels
at 2, which implies you can map a stage1 PMD huge page at stage2.
I acknowledge that the Linux naming convention does cause some confusion
for a "level" at stage1 and stage2 levels. But if you think of it
from the hardware level (and like the ARM ARM defines it , Level 0-3),
it is much simpler. i.e, you can map a huge page at level N in stage1
into stage2 if you have that level N. It doesn't matter if stage2 has
more or less number of levels than stage1, as long as stage2 table can
deal with it.

The stage2_set_pmd_huge() installs it at the PGD (level 2, which would
have been PMD if we had levels > 2) slot.

pmd = stage2_get_pmd(addr)
        \-> pud = stage2_get_pud(addr)
              \-> pgd = kvm->arch.pgd + stage2_pgd_index(addr);
              \-> (we have stage2_pgd_none(x) = 0 and
              \-> stage2_pud_offset(pgd, addr) = pgd
              \->returns (kvm->arch.pgd + stage2_pgd_index(addr);
        \->  stage_pud_none(x) = 0 & stage2_pmd_offset(pud, addr) = pud
        \->  returns pud (kvm->arch.pgd + stage2_pgd_index(addr))

and we install the PMD huge mapping at the location.

Does it matter ? Personally I don't think it matters much as long as we
are able to map the "huge" page at stage1 in the stage2 as huge, even if
the stage2 has lesser levels and manage it well. Given that PMD huge
pages are quite common, it would be good to exploit it when we can.

On the other hand, for stage2 PUD we are checking if the stage2 has a
PUD level (kvm_has_stage2_pud()). May be we should relax it just like
we do for PMD to check (kvm_stage2_levels > 2).
