Hi Eric,

Most of my comments below are just me being picky about text when
defining a user space ABI, so I think this mainly looks good, but just
needs a bit of clarify, except the versioning aspect and exporting the
pending table vie the redistributor instead, as Marc and Andre have
pointed out.

Does that mean that you can only save/restore a disabled ITS or does it
mean that initially after creating the ITS it is disabled and userspace
should restore the CWRITER before restoring GITS_CTLR (which may enable
the ITS) ?

How is this really going to work?  Your ABI here must be backwards
compatible for future revisions, so what is userspace supposed to do,
when it reads a newer revision than it was programmed for?

I think we need a more clear description of how the revision is going to
be used, such that each operation on the ITS here is described as
requiring a minimum revision X, and making sure that userspace can
safely ignore things that are of a higher revision number, while at the
same time userspace can decide not to use newer features with older
kernels.

Shouldn't this be called KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_FLUSH_ITS_TABLES ?

consider rewording: ", restoring the ITS tables will fail."

It's a bit weird to say "as follows:" and then proceed with the error
descriptions.  I would simply say "as described in the following
paragraph."

in any particular order, or?

is the ITT_addr meaningful if the entry is not valid?

I don't easily understand this last paragraph and the indentation is
weird and makes it look like it's not explaining the next field.

You're missing a description of the size field.  Size in what unit?
Size of what?

Do we explain anywhere what RES0 means?

is 'matches' the right verb to use here?

What exactly is the format of GICR_TYPER.Processor_Number ?

again, is 'matches' the right verb to use here?

here you use 'is' intead of 'matches'.  At leat be consistent.

same comments, as above.

also, can you list the field in the order they appear?

"...version 4, the first".  ("As specified in X." is not a sentence).

should or must?  or always contains zeros?  Will you return an error if
userspace puts something non-zero in there?

This comment is a bit confusing, because this is all about virtual
interrupts really, so 'physical from the point of view of the VM', but I
think you should just drop this sentence.

For nesting, yes?  (on the host this should not be visible here, should
it?)

Hmm, I thought we dealt with that before, feels a bit out of place.

> +

I feel like this should go in the ITS register description of the IIDR.
Most likely, I think this particular line can be dropped, but all other
definitions in this file can be annoted with a minimum revision number
ensuring that future revisions implement this, plus potentially more
stuff.
