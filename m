Subject: [PATCH v3 10/28] arm64/sve: Low-level CPU setup
In-Reply-To: <1507660725-7986-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>

To enable the kernel to use SVE, SVE traps from EL1 to EL2 must be
disabled.  To take maximum advantage of the hardware, the full
available vector length also needs to be enabled for EL1 by
programming ZCR_EL2.LEN.  (The kernel will program ZCR_EL1.LEN as
required, but this cannot override the limit set by ZCR_EL2.)

Traps from EL0 to EL1 are also left enabled by virtue of setting
the relevant CPACR bit at its default (RES0) value.

This patch makes the appropriate changes to the primary and
secondary CPU initialisation code.

Dropped Alex Benn?e's Reviewed-by, since there is a non-trivial change
to the logic here.

Changes since v2
----------------

Requested by Catalin Marinas:

 * Removed the asm logic to enable SVE for EL1 from __cpu_setup, since
   the kernel doesn't need SVE so early.

   Instead, this logic is moved to C code called via cpufeatures in
   "arm64/sve: Probe SVE capabilities and usable vector lengths"
   and wired up for the arm64_cpu_capabilities enable() method in
   "arm64/sve: Detect SVE and activate runtime support".
