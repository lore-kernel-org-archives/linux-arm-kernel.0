Looks good to me.

So far, we always assume that there is never more than a single source
per interrupt. We'll end-up with weird behaviours because our line_level
field is not an OR of the various inputs, but a direct assignment
(device A and B raise the line, then A drops it -> B's interrupt is gone).

I think that only the guest will be confused by it, but accepting it may
be interpreted as "this should work correctly". Would documenting that
it is a bad idea be enough?

If the documentation is enough, why not. Otherwise, we need some form of
allocator. Boring. ;-)
