It's not really an assumption so much as it's a missing feature (aka bug):
there's no reason the vGIC shouldn't support group 0 interrupts. We
just get away with only supporting group 1 because Linux guests
happen to only use group 1 interrupts. If/when the vGIC gains support
for group0 interrupts, then it should reset with interrupts configured
in group0 by default.

The only reason to make it configurable is to work around a guest
kernel bug whereby Linux assumes that all interrupts start out
in Group1. Marc sent out a patch earlier today that fixes that bug:
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/10/297
Depending on how long it takes you to fix this missing vgic feature,
such kernels may all be long-forgotten, in which case you can
get away without the config option :-)
