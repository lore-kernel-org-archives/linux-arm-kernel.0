Subject: [PATCH v6]: clk: Add common clock support for Mediatek MT8135 and
 MT8173

This patchset contains the initial common clock support for Mediatek SoCs.
Mediatek SoC's clock architecture comprises of various PLLs, dividers, muxes
and clock gates.

Changes in v2:
- Re-ordered patchset. Fold include/dt-bindings and DT document in 1st patch.

Changes in v3:
- Rebase to 3.19-rc1.
- Refine code. Remove unneed functions, debug logs and comments, and fine tune
  error logs.

Changes in v4:
- Support MT8173 platform.
- Re-ordered patchset. driver/clk/Makefile in 2nd patch.
- Extract the common part definition(mtk_gate/mtk_pll/mtk_mux) from
  clk-mt8135.c/clk-mt8173.c to clk-mtk.c.
- Refine code. Rmove unnessacary debug information and unsed defines,
  add prefix "mtk_" for static functions.
- Remove flag CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED and set flag CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT on
  gate/mux/fixed-factor.
- Use spin_lock_irqsave(&clk_ops_lock, flags) instead of mtk_clk_lock.
- Example above include a node for the clock controller itself, followed
  by the i2c controller example above.

Changes in v5:
- Add reset controller support for pericfg/infracfg
- Use regmap for the gates
- remove now unnecessary spinlock for the gates
- Add PMIC wrapper support as of v3

Changes in v6:
- rework PLL support, only a fraction of original size now
- Move binding docs to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/mediatek since
  the units are not really clock specific (they contain reset controllers)
