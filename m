Most of the performance advantage in benchmarks comes from a reduction
in the size of data-structures and/or tighter packing of arrays.  In other words,
we can make slightly better use of the caches and push the memory subsystem
a little further when running multiple instances of benchmarks.

Most of these advantages should eventually go away, when struct-reorg makes
it way into the compiler. That said, it?s a marginal (but real) improvement for a
subset of SPEC.

In the real world, the importance of ILP32 as an aid to transition legacy code
that is not 64bit clean? and this should drive the ILP32 discussion. That we
get a boost in our SPEC scores is just a nice extra that we get from it ;-)
