Maybe, but this could quickly become bloated.  (My approach already
feels a bit bloated...)

I'm not sure that arbitrarily complex negotiation will really be
needed, but userspace might want to change its mind if setting a
particular propertiy fails.

An alternative might be to have a bunch of per-VM ioctls to configure
different things, like x86 has.  There's at least precedent for that.
For arm, we currently only have a few.  That allows for easy extension,
at the cost of adding ioctls.

There may be some ioctls we can reuse, like KVM_ENABLE_CAP for per-
vm capability flags.

I just randomly came up with some names.  The precise naming scheme
isn't that important, so long as it unlikely to result in name
collisions and so long as it's reasonablu clear (or compiler-checkable,
or preferably both) which things can be used where.

I wouldn't have a problem with something a bit terser.

Sure, but best to keep it fairly rough for now.
