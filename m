I wanted to understand in more detail why the macro didn't work out for
you, so I trued hacking together my own version of the patch (see below).
It seems to hold up to light testing, so it would be good to know where
you ran into problems.

This is an arm64 patch, so either Catalin or me will pick it up directly
when it's ready to be merged.
