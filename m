Subject: [PATCHv2 11/12] arm64: enable pointer authentication
In-Reply-To: <20171127163806.31435-1-mark.rutland@arm.com>

Now that all the necessary bits are in place for userspace / KVM guest
pointer authentication, add the necessary Kconfig logic to allow this to
be enabled.

+	  Pointer authentication (part of the ARMv8.3 Extensions) provides
+	  instructions for signing and authenticating pointers against secret
+	  keys, which can be used to mitigate Return Oriented Programming (ROP)
+	  and other attacks.
+
+	  This option enables these instructions at EL0 (i.e. for userspace).
+
+	  Choosing this option will cause the kernel to initialise secret keys
+	  for each process at exec() time, with these keys being
+	  context-switched along with the process.
+
+	  The feature is detected at runtime. If the feature is not present in
+	  hardware it will not be advertised to userspace nor will it be
+	  enabled.
