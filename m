The discussion is mainly around whether USER_DS for 32-bit compat apps
should be the same as USER_DS for native 32-bit apps. Even for native
32-bit kernels, we don't use STACK_TOP as addr_limit. A read/write from
0xffffffff would fail in both cases anyway. I think the LTP test doesn't
even try to access such memory but only to probe the range validity (I
haven't managed to build the latest LTP yet).
