This last point hints at the kernel side being able to deal with
multiple versions of the ABI. As I mentioned before, this requires some
clarification on what we plan to support, and whether or not we are able
to deprecate ABIs in the long run

One thing that is not clear to me is that although you want to be able
to restore the vITS using a given ABI, should you be able to save it
using that same ABI? Or does a restore/save cycle act as an ABI upgrade
for this VM?

I'd also like to see some infrastructure in the code to support this, in
the form of a per-ABI array of support functions (even if we only have
one ABI for the time being). Although that's not required ATM, it would
certainly halp me understanding what is ABI-specific and what's not.

Thanks,

	M.
