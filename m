Subject: [PATCH v2 10/16] ARM: dts: sun7i: Add GMAC clock node to sun7i DTSI
In-Reply-To: <1389337217-29032-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
References: <1389337217-29032-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
Message-ID: <1389337217-29032-11-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The GMAC uses 1 of 2 sources for its transmit clock, depending on the
PHY interface mode. Add both sources as dummy clocks, and as parents
to the GMAC clock node.
