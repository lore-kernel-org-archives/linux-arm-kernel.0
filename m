I spent time debugging 'earlycon' for pl011, ironically using DEBUG_LL, from the
looks of it no mmio uart should work for armv7. It appears earlycon_map()
requires a fixed mapping similar to arm64.

Comparing both options, DEBUG_LL takes you from kernel decompress code to early
FDT parsing. A lot of early_print() calls won't work if DEBUG_LL is not enabled
including dump_machine_table which ends in a endless loop. IMO it's worth
turning this option on for that and other reasons.

'earlycon' is enabled some ways up in setup_arch().

As far as the patch, providing a hint to the user with probable uart addresses
would help and in the worst case "see the latest device tree for the virtual
platform".
