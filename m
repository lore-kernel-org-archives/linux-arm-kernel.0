There's something with the nomenclature that makes this really hard to
read.

you mention here: "event type", "the id", and "event number".  The
former two I think are perf identifiers, and the latter is the hardware
event number, is this right?

seems to me that the four entries above will never be used, because
you'll always match them in kvm_pmu_hw_events above?

Is this because perf map multiple generic perf events to the same
hardware event?  Does it matter if we register this with perf as one or
the other then?

why is 0xff 'unused' or reserved?  If we're choosing this arbitrarily,
why is it not 0x3ff?  Should we create a define for this?

you can just return this directly in the loop if you have a match and
unconditionally return PERF_COUNT_HW_MAX outside the loop without having
to check the loop condition.

I feel like I just read this code, can we reuse it with a pointer to the
array?

This text seems to be describing more how the function does something,
as opposed to what it does and why.  I found it a little hard to read.

don't you need to memset attr to 0 first?

otherwise, how do you ensure that for example exclude_guest is always
clear?

should the guest be able to see something counted in the hypervisor ever
or should that only be the host being able to see that?

my gut feeling is that the hypervisor should be hidden from the guest
and that exclude_hv = 0, is the right choice.  But this is a question
about the semantics of perf, I suppose.

whoa, what is this scary calculation?

definitely needs an explanation?

doesn't this mean we'll spam the kernel log if the guest supplies
bogus/unsupported event numbers?

In that case it shoudl be kvm_debug and the guest should be able to see
this somehow (e.g. events don't count).
