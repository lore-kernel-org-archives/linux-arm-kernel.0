Isn't it a bit dodgy to just overwrite x5 and x6 in something which is
not a function?  I know that in practice this always gets called through
a function call and we can rely on the calling convention, but this can
break if you issue a hypercall to KVM's HVC sub implementation using
inline assembly, I think.

Am I missing something here?
