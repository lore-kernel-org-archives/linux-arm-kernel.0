Well, it's not that bad really (untested):

The problem is that it doesn't help that much, because userspace can
still change the level of an IRQ which is connected to an in-kernel
device, unless we also introduce checking the owner field in the
injection path.

I don't see it blowing up the host with/without an allocator, so I'm
fine with documentation, but I can also include the above.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
