Do you mean define the following things in kernel:
```
diff --git a/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h b/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h
index 1caadc2..3f79640 100644
--- a/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h
+++ b/arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/unistd.h

  #include <asm-generic/unistd.h>
+
+#ifdef __ILP32__
+#undef __NR_mmap2
+#define __NR_mmap 222
+#endif /* #ifdef __ILP32__ */
+
```
Then glibc could call mmap instead of mmap2.
I could not try it now. Because after change off_t to 64bit in glibc, stat
is fail. I may need to revert the stat relative patch.

It means that we could reuse the existing code of mmap2 in kernel and glibc.
But we need to shift twice when kernel is 64k page.
It seems that the first method is more clear. Suggestion?
