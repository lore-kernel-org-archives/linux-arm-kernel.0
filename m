Subject: [PATCH v5 25/40] KVM: arm64: Introduce framework for accessing
 deferred sysregs
In-Reply-To: <20180227113429.637-1-cdall@kernel.org>

From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@linaro.org>

We are about to defer saving and restoring some groups of system
registers to vcpu_put and vcpu_load on supported systems.  This means
that we need some infrastructure to access system registes which
supports either accessing the memory backing of the register or directly
accessing the system registers, depending on the state of the system
when we access the register.

We do this by defining read/write accessor functions, which can handle
both "immediate" and "deferrable" system registers.  Immediate registers
are always saved/restored in the world-switch path, but deferrable
registers are only saved/restored in vcpu_put/vcpu_load when supported
and sysregs_loaded_on_cpu will be set in that case.

Note that we don't use the deferred mechanism yet in this patch, but only
introduce infrastructure.  This is to improve convenience of review in
the subsequent patches where it is clear which registers become
deferred.

Notes:
    Changes since v4:
     - Slightly reworded commentary based on Drew's feedback
    
    Changes since v3:
     - Changed to a switch-statement based approach to improve
       readability.
    
    Changes since v2:
     - New patch (deferred register handling has been reworked)
