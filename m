Subject: [PATCH v3 3/3] ARM: dts: Add sbs-battery for exynos5250-snow
In-Reply-To: <1360957573-864-1-git-send-email-dianders@chromium.org>

List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Now that we have i2c-arbitrator in place on bus 4 we can add the
sbs-battery driver.  Future devices will be added onto bus 4 once
drivers are in good shape.
