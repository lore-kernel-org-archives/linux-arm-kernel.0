We can also move to RB trees if we have some data to show us it's worth
the hassle later on, but I assume that since these structs are fairly
small and overhead like this is mostly to show up on a hot path, a
better optimization would be to allocate a bunch of these structures
contiguously for cache locality, but again, I feel like this is all
premature and we should measure the beast first.
