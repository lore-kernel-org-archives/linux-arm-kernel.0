It's not really that much clearer - what has any of this got to do with
the size of a page?  Just because a definition appears to be numerically
the same, it doesn't mean it should be used!

The LDR instruction takes a maximum of a 12-bit constant.  This 12-bit
constant has nothing to do with the page size; it's been that way since
the early ARMs that knew nothing about page tables.

Please instead create a LDR_IMM12_MASK or similar definition for this.
