I don't see why this needs to be in cacheflush.h - it doesn't seem to
have anything to do with cache flushing, and placing it in here means
that if you change the state of CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA_TEST, most likely
the entire kernel gets rebuilt.  Please put it in a separate header
file.

I think the intention was to place it in some .c file which gets built
into the kernel, rather than a module, so testing whether read-only
data in the kernel image is read-only.

If it's placed in a module, then you're only checking that read-only
data in the module is read-only (which is another test which should
be done!)

In any case, placing it in arch/arm/mm/init.c seems unnecessary, I'd
rather it went in its own separate file.

Seems sensible when you consider that "result" tests that _a_ fault
happened.  Verifying that the data wasn't changed seems like a belt
and braces approach, which ensures that the location really has not
been modified.

IOW, the test is "make sure that read-only data is not modified" not
"make sure that writing to read-only data causes a fault".  They're
two subtly different tests.

Finding https://lwn.net/Articles/198690/ and github links, it doesn't
seem obvious that LKDTM actually does this.  It seems more focused on
creating crashdumps than testing that (in this instance) write
protection works - and it seems to be a destructive test.
