Before we inject a timer interrupt, we can check whether the pending 
semantics of user space / kernel space match. If they don't match, we 
can exit before we inject the interrupt and allow user space to disable 
the pending state again.

In this scheme, I would simply say "user space thinks it's pending" == 
"host vtimer irq is masked". So because user space thinks that no timer 
is pending and the guest managed to trigger a vtimer irq on the host, 
the guest exited on a physical vtimer irq. Kvm then checks whether the 
timer expired and sets the vcpu timer pending status to 1. User space 
status is still 0, so kvm exits to user space to update the status.

I mean the guest sets pstate.I = 0.

Why is that a bug? The line really is still pending at this point.

The guest sets pstate.I=1.

cntv.ctl.imask = 0 here, but user space doesn't know that yet. So the 
"pending" state is still active.

I'm sure one of them has to be racy? :)

(in fact, there are probably more than what I came up with that really 
are...)
