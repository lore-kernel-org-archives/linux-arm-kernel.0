Hi James,
   Sorry for my late response, thank you very much for comments.

consider again. I think you should be right.
In the firmware-first solution, firmware will shield all kinds of errors and record them to the CPER buffer.

Yes, if it is firmware-first we should not exist such issue.

understand, thanks.

Before I remember Marc and you suggest me specify the an impdef ESR (set the vsesr_el2) in
the userspace,
now do you want to specify an impdef ESR in KVM instead of usrspace?
if setting the vsesr_el2 in the KVM, whether user-space need to specify?
May be we can combine the patches that specify an impdef ESR(set vsesr_el2) patch to one.

yes, thanks.
Because SEI notification support does not depend on the RAS virtualization, I break them out of this
series.
they are here(Today Tyler have some comments, I will update it)

James, it is great, we can make a consolidated version of the series.

firstly the physical-SError that happened in the EL2/EL1/EL1 can not be masked if SCR_EL3.EA is set.

when trap to EL3, firmware will record the error to APEI CPER from reading ERR* RAS registers.

(1) if HCR_EL2.TEA is set to 1, exception come from EL0, El1. firmware knows this SError come from guest OS, copy the elr_el3 to elr_el2, copy ESR_El3 to ESR_EL2.
    if the SError exception come from guest EL0 or EL1, set ELR_EL3 with VBAR_EL2 + 0x580(one EL2 SEI entry point),

    execute "ERET", then jump to EL2 hypervisor.

(2)if the SError exception come EL2 hypervisor, copy the elr_el3 to elr_el2, copy ESR_El3 to ESR_EL, set ELR_EL3 with VBAR_EL2+0x380(one EL2 SEI entry point),

   execute "ERET", then jump to EL2 hypervisor.


(2) if HCR_EL2.TEA is set to 0, SError come from host EL1 ,EL0, copy ELR_EL3 to ELR_EL1,ESR_EL3 to ESR_EL1
    if the SError come from host EL0, set ELR_EL3 with VBAR_EL1+0x580
    if the SError come from host EL1, set ELR_EL3 with VBAR_EL1+0x380

  execute "ERET", then jump to host EL1.
