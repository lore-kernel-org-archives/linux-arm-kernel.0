Hi Marc,
   thanks for reviewing, I was thinking to post this
first and next iteration on guest access switch
back to host registers only upon  return to user space or
vCPU context switch. This should save more cycles for
various exits.

Were you thinking along the same lines or something
altogether different?

Lmbench is what I typically use, with ssh server, i.e., cause page
faults and interrupts - usually registers are not touched.
I'll run the tests again and define usually.

Any other loads you had in mind?

Yep will do.

Yeah, will change needed help/feedback on this.

Will do.

I'm thinking would it make sense to update the armv7 side as
well. When reading both exit handlers the flow mirrors
each other.
