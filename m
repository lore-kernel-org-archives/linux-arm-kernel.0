I should learn how that works. We have way too many configuration
files on ARM and it would be nice to use Kconfig fragments to
simplify it a little for things like enabling LPAE or big-endian.
The kernelci.org folks do that already, but it's not in mainline.

FWIW, on tinyconfig, the __modver section remains at 1784 with or
without my patch, and the size difference with my patch applied
is down to 5412 bytes mostly in .text, around 0.50% of the total size.

Correct.

Ok, I'll prepare an updated version with that change.
