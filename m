Yes, but actually, using bit #0 is maybe a better alternative in any
case. You can never dereference SP with bit #0 set, regardless of
whether the address points to user or kernel space, and my concern
about reloading sp from x29 doesn't really make sense, given that x29
is always assigned from sp right after pushing x29 and x30 in the
function prologue, and sp only gets restored from x29 in the epilogue
when there is a stack frame to begin with, in which case we add #1 to
sp again before returning from the function.

The other code gets a lot cleaner as well.

So for the return we'll have

  ldp     x29, x30, [sp], #nn
>>add     sp, sp, #0x1
  ret

and for the function call

  bl      <foo>
>>mov      x30, sp
>>bic     sp, x30, #1

The restore sequence in entry.s:96 (which has no spare registers) gets
much simpler as well:
