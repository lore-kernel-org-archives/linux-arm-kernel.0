Since dealing with VA ranges tends to hurt my brain badly, let's
start with a bit of documentation that will hopefully help
understanding what comes next...

+ * kernel address). We need to find out how many bits to mask.
  *
- * ARMv8.1 (using VHE) does have a TTBR1_EL2, and doesn't use these
- * macros (the entire kernel runs at EL2).
+ * We want to build a set of page tables that cover both parts of the
+ * idmap (the trampoline page used to initialize EL2), and our normal
+ * runtime VA space, at the same time.
+ *
+ * Given that the kernel uses VA_BITS for its entire address space,
+ * and that half of that space (VA_BITS - 1) is used for the linear
+ * mapping, we can limit the EL2 space to the same size.
+ *
+ * The main question is "Within the VA_BITS space, does EL2 use the
+ * top or the bottom half of that space to shadow the kernel's linear
+ * mapping?". As we need to idmap the trampoline page, this is
+ * determined by the range in which this page lives.
+ *
+ * If the page is in the bottom half, we have to use the top half. If
+ * the page is in the top half, we have to use the bottom half:
+ *
+ * if (PA(T)[VA_BITS - 1] == 1)
+ *	HYP_VA_RANGE = [0 ... (1 << (VA_BITS - 1)) - 1]
+ * else
+ *	HYP_VA_RANGE = [(1 << (VA_BITS - 1)) ... (1 << VA_BITS) - 1]
+ *
+ * In practice, the second case can be simplified to
+ *	HYP_VA_RANGE = [0 ... (1 << VA_BITS) - 1]
+ * because we'll never get anything in the bottom range.
+ *
+ * This of course assumes that the trampoline page exists within the
+ * VA_BITS range. If it doesn't, then it means we're in the odd case
+ * where the kernel idmap (as well as HYP) uses more levels than the
+ * kernel runtime page tables (as seen when the kernel is configured
+ * for 4k pages, 39bits VA, and yet memory lives just above that
+ * limit, forcing the idmap to use 4 levels of page tables while the
+ * kernel itself only uses 3). In this particular case, it doesn't
+ * matter which side of VA_BITS we use, as we're guaranteed not to
+ * conflict with anything.
+ *
+ * An alternative would be to always use 4 levels of page tables for
+ * EL2, no matter what the kernel does. But who wants more levels than
+ * strictly necessary?
+ *
+ * Thankfully, ARMv8.1 (using VHE) does have a TTBR1_EL2, and doesn't
+ * need any of this madness (the entire kernel runs@EL2).
