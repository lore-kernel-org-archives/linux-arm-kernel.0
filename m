You mean floating-point exception? (almost anything that is not an
interrupt can be a sunchronous exception on arm64).

Interesting though.  arm and arm64 have send_sig_info() here, but
all other arches seem to have force_sig_info().

sigaction(2) says:
"According to POSIX, the behavior of a process is undefined after it
ignores a SIGFPE, SIGILL, or SIGSEGV signal that was not generated by
kill(2) or raise(3)."

I can't find the POSIX reference for this, but the above suggests we
don't _have_ to kill the process.  arm/arm64 do seem inconsistent on
this though, compared with other architectures.  force_sig_info() might
be needed to avoid a spin on architectures where writeback is
suppressed when a precise fp exception trap is taken and the exception
return address points back to the offending instruction.  I'm
struggling to deduce from the ARM ARM whether this applies here.

Maybe it doesn't matter what we do: the state of the standards seems
to mean that user code that attempts to recover from FP exceptions
will be nonportable and probably broken in any case...


Russell, do you remember the motivation for this?  I'm looking at
da41119af788 ("[PATCH] ARM: Don't force SIGFPE")

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] [PATCH] ARM: Don't force SIGFPE

We were forcing SIGFPE on to a user program for no good reason.
Use send_sig_info() instead.
