I think you wrot in the last review thread that this should be renamed
"arch_timer_get_freq()".

This comment about the .dts file is completely out-of-place.
The error message should be about the register containing 0, right?

Also, at this very point in the code, I think you should convert that panic()
to pr_err() and insert:

#include <linux/clk.h>

struct clk *clk;

clk = clk_get_sys("arm_generic_timer", NULL);
if (IS_ERR(clk))
               panic("Not even a clk to get freq off! Giving up.\n");
err = clk_prepare_enable(clk);
if (err) {
           pr_err("smp_twd: clock failed to prepare: %d\n", err);
           clk_put(clk);
           panic("Not even a clk to get freq off! Giving up.\n");
}
arch_timer_rate = clk_get_rate(clk);

Possibly the clk should even be able to override the register value,
then it's the other way around.

This multiplier and print should be moved below the call site since
the DT frequency
overrides it and then you get no print which is sad, and incorrect
sched_clock_mult
which is a bug.

rename arch_timer_get_freq()

And move that print here.
