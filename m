Subject: [PATCH v3 0/2] KVM: Fix refaulting due to page table update
Message-ID: <20180813104351.24595-1-punit.agrawal@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Contention when updating a page table entry can lead to unnecessary
refaults. The issue was reported by a user when testing PUD hugepage
support[1] but also exists for PMD and PTE updates though with a lower
probability.

This version -

* fixes a nit reported by Suzuki
* Re-orders the checks when setting PMD hugepage
* drops mistakenly introduced Change-id in the commit message

Thanks,
Punit
