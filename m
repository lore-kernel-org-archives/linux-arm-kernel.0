One thing I don't like about this is that we're reading FAR_EL1 even
though we don't know whether it's valid. It could contain junk, and we
could spuriously jump into the slow path. That's liable to make
performance erratic.

Given we have to stash a GPR anyway, we can check whether the SP is
valid in the fast-path, and that should be the only check we require. I
think we can also get rid of the overflow heuristic by checking that the
SP is strictly in the THREAD_SIZE stack area.

This also seems a bit "magic", as we're relying on what the entry asm
will have done in a very specific case.

Thanks,
Mark.
