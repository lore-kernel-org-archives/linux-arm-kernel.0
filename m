Finding a source of entropy is not trivial, but it is not the difficult part.

So when we pass some random seed to the decompressor, what will it do
with it? In order to find a suitable KASLR offset, it needs to know
the size of DRAM, the placement of the DT and potentially an initrd,
and the size of the vmalloc region in order to decide where it can put
the kernel.

In my implementation, the decompressor simply receives the offset from
the bootloader, and exposes the value of PAGE_OFFSET, the base of  the
vmalloc region and the kaslr granularity supported by the kernel. The
bootloader should already know the size of DRAM and where it loaded
the DT and initrd, so it can roll the dice in an informed manner.

Note that my UEFI stub implementation essentially does the same, which
was trivial to implement because UEFI already keeps track of all
allocations in DRAM. Note that this version simply disables KASLR if
it encounters a vmalloc= command line argument, given that it affects
the size of the lowmem region. We could enhance that to actually parse
the value, but I kept it simple for now.
