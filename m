Subject: [PATCH 18/30] ARM: kernel: make vmlinux buildable as a PIE executable
In-Reply-To: <20170814125411.22604-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
References: <20170814125411.22604-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <20170814125411.22604-19-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Update the build flags and linker script to allow vmlinux to be build
as a PIE  binary, which retains relocation information about absolute
symbol references so that they can be fixed up at runtime. This will
be used for implementing KASLR,

+ * GCC assumes that we are building shared libraries or hosted binaries
+ * when the -fpic or -fpie switches are used. This results in all references
+ * to symbols with external linkage to be redirected via entries in the global
+ * offset table (GOT), which keeps .text pages clean and reduces the footprint
+ * of CoWed dirty pages to the GOT itself. It also allows symbol preemption,
+ * which is mandatory under ELF rules for shared libraries.
+ *
+ * For the kernel, we use PIC so that we can relocate the executable image at
+ * runtime. This does not involve CoW or symbol preemption, and we'd rather
+ * have relative references instead of absolute ones whenever possible.
+ * So set the default visibility to hidden: this informs the compiler that
+ * none of our symbols will ever be exported from a shared library, allowing
+ * it to use relative references where possible.
+ *
+ * Note that simply passing -fvisibility=hidden is not sufficient to achieve
+ * this: In that case, definitions will be marked hidden, but declarations
+ * will not, and we still end up with GOT entries unnecessarily.
