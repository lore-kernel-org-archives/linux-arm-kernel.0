I started implementing the same thing yesterday. Somehow, it feels
slightly better to have the same flow for all level interrupts,
including the timer, and we only use the MI on EOI as a way to trigger
the next state of injection. Still testing, but looking good so far.

I'm still puzzled that we have this level-but-not-quite behaviour for
VFIO interrupts. At some point, it is going to bite us badly.
