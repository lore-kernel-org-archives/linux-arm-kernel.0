TBH patch #3 is just a q'n'd hack to ensure that the TVM bit remains
set in HCR. I was assuming that cleaning the entire cache on mmu
enable/disable would be sufficient to quantify the performance impact
and check whether patch #2 works as advertised.

I was wondering: isn't calling stage2_flush_vm() for each set of each
way very costly?
