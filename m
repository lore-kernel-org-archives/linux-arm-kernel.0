does it also work for vLPI? The spec mentions ICID/pINTID only.

I would put the above paragraph before the enable/disable and guest
INT/CLEAR bullet.

What is difficult to understand is there is also another mapping between
the vPE and the physical RDist which is handled by the below
irq_set_affinity.

So that's the odd part for me because I would have imagined set_affinity
would have applied to this doorbell LPI and change the affinity of this
physical MSI. But as the doorbell MSI embodies the VPE, well this makes
sense to me
