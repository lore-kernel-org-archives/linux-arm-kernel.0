I?m not 100% convinced that this is the case. Emulating the GIC in user space can have other interesting use cases. For example, it might come in handy for nesting. It may be useful for migrating a gicv2 VM to a gicv3 host without gicv2 emulation as well.

I actually verified all of this patch on 4.8-rc5 upstream, which is the only 64bit kernel you can find for the RPi. So I?d expect the situation to change with 64bit.

Having CPU pins accessible is very useful for use cases of KVM that are beyond your traditional VM.

That?s what I thought too, but turns out that it?s not quite as simple as I hoped ;). Also, I much rather at least have a common notion of ?arch timers are always available on arm64? than ?kvm always uses the vgic?. The former has much more impact and much more reach.
