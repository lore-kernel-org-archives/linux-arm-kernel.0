Subject: [PATCH] [v4.15-stable] arm64: dts: add #cooling-cells to CPU nodes
Message-ID: <20180221162934.2728048-1-arnd@arndb.de>

commit acbf76ee05067c3942852019993f7beb69a0f45f upstream.

dtc complains about the lack of #coolin-cells properties for the
CPU nodes that are referred to as "cooling-device":

arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt8173-evb.dtb: Warning (cooling_device_property): Missing property '#cooling-cells' in node /cpus/cpu at 0 or bad phandle (referred from /thermal-zones/cpu_thermal/cooling-maps/map at 0:cooling-device[0])
arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt8173-evb.dtb: Warning (cooling_device_property): Missing property '#cooling-cells' in node /cpus/cpu at 100 or bad phandle (referred from /thermal-zones/cpu_thermal/cooling-maps/map at 1:cooling-device[0])

Apparently this property must be '<2>' to match the binding.
