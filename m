There are more conditions: the only place the determination is
made is for next, in fpsimd_thread_switch(next).


However, I can see your concern and I'm not sure how/if it is
resolved.

For the worst case, let's assume that some child forks off but
doesn't enter userspace yet, while another task round-robins
across all CPUs, interspersed with tasks that don't enter userspace.

So, we end up with

All cpu < NR_CPUS . per_cpu(fpsimd_last_state, cpu) == T.

Now, if T dies and a new task is allocated the same task_struct pointer,
then the _new_ T is guaranteed to get scheduled in on a CPU whose
per_cpu(fpsmid_last_state) == T.

Thus, new T can pick up old T's regs _unless_ new T's fpsimd_state.cpu
is invalid (i.e., NR_CPUS).

This is a separate bug from the one addressed by this patch though.
We can't go and harvest the bad pointers when old T exits, because
this might race new T being scheduled for real -- in any case it
would involve iterating over all CPUs which sounds racy and
inefficient.


So, I'd say we _must_ call fpsimd_flush_task_state() for every new
task.  This may result in a redundant reload of the state, but this
is what would happen anyway if the pointers did not alias.

Does this sound real to you?  If so, I'll try to write something.

And does this patch look reasonable to fix what it's trying to fix?


I wonder whether arch/arm has the same bug actually, since the kernel-
mode NEON logic was modelled from there IIUC (?)
