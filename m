I think always using inner-shareable should be ok. If you wanted to optimise
this, you'd want to avoid the workaround altogether for non-shareable
invalidation, but that's fairly rare and I doubt you'd be able to measure
the impact.

It also strikes me as odd that you only need one extra TLBI after the loop
has finished, as opposed to a tlbi; dsb; tlbi loop body (which is what you'd
get if you modified __tlbi as I suggest).

Is it sufficient to have one extra TLBI after the loop and, if so, is the
performance impact of my suggestion therefore unacceptable?
