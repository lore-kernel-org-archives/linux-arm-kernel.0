For the record I don't think this is necessarily a completely valid
conclusion.  The fact that you access multiple members of a struct is a
good indication that it might be a good idea to hold a lock, but it's
not as simple as that.

I think the only thing that could happen here is that a caller
mistakenly evaluates line_level when it shouldn't, but that would only
happen when changing the configuration of an irq from level to edge,
while the line_level is high, expecting the line_level to go down, and
the pending state to be subsequently reported as false, but we only
support changing the configuration of an interrupt when it's disabled,
and as a result this can only affect reads of the PENDR registers.

Note, I'm fine with this change, but I don't agree with the rationale.
The rationale is to take the lock on every use for consistency and to
make the code easier to reason about, but it's possible that some future
analysis in the future would relax this requirement if essential for
performance.

Thanks,
