Ouch. Thanks for the report, and sorry about this.

The problem is that I evaluate the ptr argument twice in
__{get,put}_user(), and this may have side effects.

e.g. when the ELF loader does things like:

  __put_user((elf_addr_t)p, sp++)

... we increment sp twice, and write to the wrong user address, leaving
sp corrupt.

I have an additional patch [1] to fix this, which is in my
arm64/access-ok branch [2].

Thanks,
Mark.
