Well, that's only regarding safety, not regarding functionality, right?
So if we could break the kernel by not providing the flag and/or devid,
this needs to be fixed. But if it just doesn't work, that's OK.

I agree on this. Usually this kind of redundancy leads to strange code,
but this does not seem to apply here, since we can at least still guard
the assignments to demonstrate that the devid field needs to go along
with the flag.

Cheers,
Andre.
