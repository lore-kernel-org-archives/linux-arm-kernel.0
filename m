As far as I can see, this is going to result in unreliable counts on a
big.LITTLE system, even if the VCPUs are constrained to one class of
core.

As this is a task-bound event (cpu == -1, task is current), the perf
core will stop as soon as one PMU driver agrees to handle the event. The
event will then only count on CPUs handled by that driver.

If you're unlucky, the set of CPUs handled by that driver is not the
same as the set of CPUs your VM is constrained to. e.g. your VM might be
on little cores, but the big PMU driver accepted the event, and only
counts on big cores.

I'm not sure how we can solve that.

Thanks,
Mark.
