Subject: [PATCH v3 9/9] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Update documentation of the
 GICv2 device
In-Reply-To: <1531587940-2490-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
References: <1531587940-2490-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
Message-ID: <1531587940-2490-10-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Update the documentation to reflect the ordering requirements of
restoring GICv2 distributor registers and remove outdated limitations in
the documentation while we're at it.
