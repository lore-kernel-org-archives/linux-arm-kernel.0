Subject: [PATCH 00/10] KVM: arm: debug infrastructure support
Message-ID: <1431751551-4788-1-git-send-email-zhichao.huang@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

This patch series adds debug support, a key feature missing from the
KVM/armv7 port.

The main idea is borrowed from armv8, which is to keep track of whether 
the debug registers are "dirty" (changed by the guest) or not. In this 
case, perform the usual save/restore dance, for one run only. It means 
we only have a penalty if a guest is actively using the debug registers.

The amount of registers is properly frightening, but CPUs actually
only implement a subset of them. Also, there is a number of registers
we don't bother emulating (things having to do with external debug and
OSlock).

External debug is when you actually plug a physical JTAG into the CPU.
OSlock is a way to prevent "other software" to play with the debug
registers. My understanding is that it is only useful in combination
with the external debug. In both case, implementing support for this
is probably not worth the effort, at least for the time being.

This has been tested on a Cortex-A15 platform, running 32bit guests.

The patches for this series are based off v4.1-rc3 and can be found
