Besides the incredible bikesheding nature of your comments, I disagree.
The current code suggests where to add functionality once we move to
using the physical timer hardware to drive an EL1 physical timer on VHE
systems, and is purposely written this way.

I'm sure we have real bugs and real issues in the code, perhaps you
could spend your energy looking for those, and if you cannot find any,
then provide a reviewed-by instead of these pointless cosmetic
adjustments.

Thanks,
