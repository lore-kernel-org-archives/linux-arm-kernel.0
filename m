Sure, I will if needed. Regarding your comments below, I will fix the
patch series after Drew's comments, if any.

I will change the comment above to "Total instrs".

You are right. The cycle indeed depends on the design. Will fix.

In theory, I think this can happen when mcr is executed before all loop
instructions completed, causing pmccntr_read() to miss some cycles. But
QEMU TCG mode doesn't support out-order-execution. So the test
condition, "cpi > 0 && cycles != i * cpi", will never be TRUE. Because
cpi==0 in KVM, this same test condition won't be TRUE under KVM mode either.

Agreed. Most isb() instructions were added following CP15 writes (not
all CP15 writes, but at limited locations). We tried to follow what
Linux kernel does in perf_event.c. If you feel that any isb() place
needs special comment, I will be more than happy to add it.
