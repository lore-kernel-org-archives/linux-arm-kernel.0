I think a few words to that effect in the function comments would be
helpful:

  /*
   * sve_update_vq_map only cares about CPUs at boot time and is called
   * serially for each one. Any CPUs added later via hotplug will fail
   * at sve_verify_vq_map if they don't match what is detected here.

Yes please, that would be cleaner.
