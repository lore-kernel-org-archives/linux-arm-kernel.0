It's a git tag from the repo at git://github.com/ARM-software/edk2 .
In fact I'm not quite sure we are at that exact tag, since it seems like
some fixes present in v3.0-rc0 are missing from our code base.
But it's an early 2015 drop in any case.

Looks like an alternate version of that fix is present in the ARM repo
as commit 152ac4, and we have that fix in our repo too.

It does seem that it conflicts with trying to use a GIC v2 in the DT
for tip Linux, though.

I believe we do set PcdArmGicV3WithV2Legacy to TRUE for
our platform, but we did require my patch above in addition:

[PcdsFeatureFlag.common]

   # Force the UEFI GIC driver to use GICv2 legacy mode. To use
   # GICv3 without GICv2 legacy in UEFI, the ARM Trusted Firmware needs
   # to configure the Non-Secure interrupts in the GIC Redistributors
   # which is not supported at the moment.
   gArmTokenSpaceGuid.PcdArmGicV3WithV2Legacy|TRUE

We have the GIC at different addresses in any case, but I will check
with our hardware folks to see if we should be using different
addresses if we try to use a GIC v3.  Thanks!
