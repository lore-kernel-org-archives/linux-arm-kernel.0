Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 4/4] ARM: sun8i: h3: add support for the thermal sensor
 in H3
In-Reply-To: <20170402133304.56824-1-icenowy@aosc.io>
References: <20170402133304.56824-1-icenowy@aosc.io>
Message-ID: <20170402133304.56824-5-icenowy@aosc.io>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

As we have gained the support for the thermal sensor in H3, we can now
add its device nodes to the device tree.

Add them to the H3 device tree.

The H5 thermal sensor has some differences, and will be added furtherly.
