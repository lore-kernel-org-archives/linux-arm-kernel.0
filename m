No you're not missing anything, indeed, that is broken.  I think I had
in the back of my mind that we disable stuff in the world-switch still,
but that obviously doesn't apply to the soft timers.

I'll just move this patch following the next one where interrupts are
disabled.

Nice catch!

Yes, I've moved the addition of the test to this patch which actually
uses is.
