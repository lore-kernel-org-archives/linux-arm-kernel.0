So, something like:

Top-level functions:

static __always_inline rare_write_begin(void)
{
    preempt_disable();
    local_irq_disable();
    barrier();
    __arch_rare_write_begin();
    barrier();
}

static __always_inline rare_write_end(void)
{
    barrier();
    __arch_rare_write_end();
    barrier();
    local_irq_enable();
    preempt_enable_no_resched();
}

x86-specific helpers:

static __always_inline unsigned long __arch_rare_write_begin(void)
{
       unsigned long cr0;

       cr0 = read_cr0() ^ X86_CR0_WP;
       BUG_ON(cr0 & X86_CR0_WP);
       write_cr0(cr0);
       return cr0 ^ X86_CR0_WP;
}

static __always_inline unsigned long __arch_rare_write_end(void)
{
       unsigned long cr0;

       cr0 = read_cr0() ^ X86_CR0_WP;
       BUG_ON(!(cr0 & X86_CR0_WP));
       write_cr0(cr0);
       return cr0 ^ X86_CR0_WP;
}

I can give it a spin...
