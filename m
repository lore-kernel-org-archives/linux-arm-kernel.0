Just so I understand, the difference between this and vcpu_mode_is_32bit 
is that vcpu_mode_is_32bit might return true because an 
interrupt/exception occured while guest was executing 32bit EL0 but 
guest EL1 is still 64bits, is that correct?

Also, it seems the process controlling KVM is supposed to provide the 
information of whether the vcpu runs a 32bit el1, would it be better to do:

	return test_bit(KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT, vcpu->arch.features);

instead of looking at the hcr? Or is there a case where those might differ?

Otherwise:
