Having just wired up bpf on an Alpha and run samples/bpf/test_verifier
I get:

#0 add+sub+mul OK
#1 unreachable OK
#2 unreachable2 OK
#3 out of range jump OK

[snip many passing tests]

#69 unpriv: check that printk is disallowed FAIL
failed to load prog 'Invalid argument'
0: (7a) *(u64 *)(r10 -8) = 0
1: (bf) r1 = r10
2: (07) r1 += -8
3: (b7) r2 = 8
4: (bf) r3 = r1
5: (85) call 6
unknown func 6

[snip many more passing tests]

Summary: 101 PASSED, 1 FAILED

Should I be concerned about the failing #69 test?

Cheers
Michael.
