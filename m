This series introduces STM32MP1 RTC.
On STM32MP1:
- two clocks are needed, plck and rtc_ck;
- to wakeup the system, a wakeup alarm interrupt is needed;
- some registers or bits have moved, but the operation is the same;
- the Backup Domain Protection (DBP) is not managed by RTC driver.

Amelie Delaunay (3):
  rtc: stm32: rework register management to prepare other version of RTC
  dt-bindings: rtc: update stm32-rtc documentation for stm32mp1 rtc
  rtc: stm32: add stm32mp1 rtc support
