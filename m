Sorry, I forgot how this works again.  If we do have firmware-first, are
we sure that the firmware doesn't just emulate the SError to EL2,
resulting in it looking the same whether or not we have firmware-first?
(perhaps the firmware-first thing clearly defines what should happen
when the firmware detects an SError?)

are esb instructions ignored on earlier versions than ARMv8.2?  (I
couldn't easily determine this from the spec)

So this is not necessarily the world switch path we're entering (as
hinted in the commit message), but we could also be doing TLB
maintenance.  Is this still going to work in that case?
