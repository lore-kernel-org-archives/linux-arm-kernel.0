I agree it's confusing (I got it wrong first time as well and used the
wrong alternative for futex).

I find it more confusing. In the non-UAO case, get_user etc. would
normally have to use privileged_uaccess_enable() since ldr is not
replaced with ldtr. Maybe uaccess_enable_for_exclusives() but it doesn't
look any better. I think adding some comments to the code
(uaccess_enable macro) would work better, clarifying what the
alternative is for.
