That's mostly what I had in mind. Basically staying away from touching
the FP registers until vcpu_put(). I had it mostly working, but
experienced some interesting corruption cases, specially when using
32bit guests.

Not really (apart from running hackbench, of course...;-). I'd just like
to see the numbers in the commit message, so that we can document the
improvement (and maybe track regressions).

The 32bit code is starting to show its age, and could probably do with a
refactor. If you have some cycles to spare, that'd be quite interesting.

Thanks,
