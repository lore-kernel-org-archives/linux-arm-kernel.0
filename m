Some control bits seem to be explicitly called out to not affect TLB
maintenance operations[0] but I hadn't considered the ones you highlight.

[0] ARMv8 ARM DDI 0487A.j D4.7, Pg D4-1814

Although, the RES0 bits for TLBI VA ops are currently ignored, I agree
that masking them out based on granule size protects against future
incompatible changes.

That sounds reasonable for correctness. But I suspect we'll have to do
more to claw back some performance. Let me run a few tests and come back
on this.

Thanks for having a look.
