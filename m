Hi Arnd,

No, it does not since vdso_data structure is not part of the ABI and the userspace can access the vdso library only via function symbols. There was a proposal some time ago to introduce ABI data structures in the vdso data page but it was rejected [1] and [2].

CONFIG_GENERIC_VDSO_32 is meant to be used in 32 bit only platforms and the rationale behind it is to preserve performances were possible.

I agree with you, we should address the y2038 support here, even if there are some architectures that currently use u32 for CLOCK_REALTIME sec.
