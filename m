I was assuming that the linked would bump up the segment alignment if a
more-aligned object were placed inside. I guess that doesn't happen in
all cases?

... or do you mean when the EFI stub relocates the kernel, assuming
relaxed alignment constraints?

I guess, but at that point, why bother?

That gives us a fuzzy check for one specific "stack overflow", while not
catching the general case.

So long as we have a reliable stack trace, we can figure out that was
the case, and we don't set the expectation that we're trying to
categorize the general case (minefield and all).

Thanks,
Mark.
