From: Ondrej Jirman <megous@megous.com>

Add SY8106A regulator to r_i2c bus and enable the r_i2c bus on
Orange Pi PC, then set the power supply of the ARM cores to this
regulator, in order to enable DVFS.

Changes in v2:
- Reduce maximum voltage to 1.3V.
- Slightly changed the comment at 1.0V minimum voltage for taking BSP
  DVFS table instead of Armbian one.
