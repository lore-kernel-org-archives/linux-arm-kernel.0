Naming is hard :-/

This runs into the problem of slightly different ret semantics for here
and in handle_exit. Maybe just having a bool response and:

    if (kvm_arm_should_complete_emulated_instr_debug(vcpu))
        return 0;

And then in handle_exit:

    if (handled == 1 && kvm_arm_should_complete_emulated_instr_debug(vcpu))
        return 0;
    else
        return handled;
