The worse case is that we end-up with a VMAPVI that silently fails, and
the guest doesn't gets its interrupts. The real issue here is that we
don't expose the size of the VPT allocation to the guest. I'll see how
to address this.

Sure. But given that we'll never use target_vcpu for anything either (we
keep the vlpi mapped), I'm not sure what this gets us...

Thanks,
