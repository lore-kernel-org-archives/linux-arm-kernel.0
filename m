Posting code during the merge-window isn't helpful as the kernel is a moving
target, its better to wait for an 'rc' to base it on.

'git fetch' Linus' tree and look at the tags. 'v4.16' lost its '-rc' suffixes,
and there isn't a 'v4.17-rc1' yet, so we are still in the merge window.

Linus sends a message to LKML. eg:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/1/175

net-next closes shortly before the merge window, and re-opens afterwards. There
is a handy web page:

Lets keep that discussion on v9 then.

Problem here, more on v9.
