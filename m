I tend to agree with this.  Who did you loose this argument against and
do you have a pointer?

That could be solved by always just doing a (u64) conversion on the
caller/receiver side.  E.g.

int vgic_handle_mmio_access(..., int len, void *val, bool is_write)
{
	u64 data;

	if (unsupported_vgic_len(len))
		return -ENXIO;

	if (is_write)
		data = mmio_read_buf(val, len);

	// data is now just some data of some lenght in a typed register

	call_range_handler(vcpu, &data, len, ...);

	if (!is_write)
		mmio_write_buf(val, len, data);
}

(and share the mmio_ functions in a header file between mmio.c and
consumers of the packed data).

The idea would be that the gic is just emulation code in C, which can be
compiled to some endianness, and we really don't care about how it's
physically stored in memory.

no we cannot, but we can use a typed pointer instead of a void pointer
everywhere in the vgic code, since the max access we're going to support
is 64 bits.

No, it doesn't add anymore confusion.  I think option (b) is what we
should do, unless it's not possible for some reason that I fail to
realize at this very moment.

If all your pointers in the vgic emulation code are always typed, then I
don't see why you'd have to worry about endianness anywhere?

The only place we should worry about endianness is the
vcpu_data_guest_to_host() and vcpu_data_host_to_guest() functions.
Doing it anywhere else as well is an indication that we're doing
something wrong.
