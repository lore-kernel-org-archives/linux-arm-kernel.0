Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 6/6] arm64: signal: Report signal frame size to
 userspace via auxv

Stateful CPU architecture extensions may require the signal frame
to grow to a size that exceeds the arch's MINSIGSTKSZ #define.
However, changing this #define is an ABI break.

To allow userspace the option of determining the signal frame size
in a more forwards-compatible way, this patch adds a new auxv entry
tagged with AT_MINSIGSTKSZ, which provides the maximum signal frame
size that the process can observe during its lifetime.

If AT_MINSIGSTKSZ is absent from the aux vector, the caller can
assume that the MINSIGSTKSZ #define is sufficient.  This allows for
a consistent interface with older kernels that do not provide
AT_MINSIGSTKSZ.

The idea is that libc could expose this via sysconf() or some
similar mechanism.

There is deliberately no AT_SIGSTKSZ.  The kernel knows nothing
about userspace's own stack overheads and should not pretend to
know.

For arm64:

The primary motivation for this interface is the Scalable Vector
Extension, which can require at least 4KB or so of extra space
in the signal frame for the largest hardware implementations.

To determine the correct value, a "Christmas tree" mode (via the
add_all argument) is added to setup_sigframe_layout(), to simulate
addition of all possible records to the signal frame at maximum
possible size.

If this procedure goes wrong somehow, resulting in a stupidly large
frame layout and hence failure of sigframe_alloc() to allocate a
record to the frame, then this is indicative of a kernel bug: the
kernel's internal SIGFRAME_MAXSZ is supposed to sanity-check
against generting frames that we consider _impossibly_ large.  In
this case, SIGSTKSZ is returned as a "reasonable guess that is at
least bigger than MINSIGSTKSZ" and we WARN().

Notes:

1)

Should AT_MINSIGSTKSZ be defined globally?

If there's a likelihood that one or more other arches may make use
of this mechanism, then the define could be moved to
linux/include/uapi/linux/auxvec.h.

Either way, userspace code can do #ifdef AT_MINSIGSTKSZ, so the
define can be left arch-specific without serious source
incompatibility for userspace.  The chosen number is ABI though:
currently it's in the arch-specific space (>= 32).

2)

The kernel has an ABI commitment not to generate larger signal
frames than userspace expects, so another mechanism would be needed
to "turn on" the generation of larger frames.

For now I don't anticipate a global mechanism for this.  For SVE,
I currently have a mechanism to limit the vector length given to
new processes by default, thus avoiding signal frames larger than
MINSIGSTKSZ being seen unless the program explicitly asks for
longer vectors.

3)

This patch feels like an abuse of ARCH_DLINFO, but I didn't
feel it was worth hacking the core code just for this...

If anyone objects, I'm happy to propose a new macro (or a new name
for the existing macro).

4)

For arm64, when the signal frame has not been enlarged, the true
size is returned, which is slightly smaller than MINSIGSTKSZ.

Since callers must know their own stack overheads in order to make
use of the result, and since we have no way to know those, this
probably doesn't matter.

There could be an argument for returning MINSIGSTKSZ though, in
case there is software that assumes for other reasons that stacks
are at least MINSIGSTKSZ in size.  By definition this interface
can't expect to ensure 100% compatibility, so it's not clear
whether this matters.  Userspace that cares could equally implement
this clamping itself.
