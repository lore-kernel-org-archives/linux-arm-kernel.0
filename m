No, the whole point of this type of kernel image is that it doesn't need
a specific load address; the kernel zImage can run from anywhere in RAM
(provided AUTO_ZRELADDR is enabled, subject to some slight
restrictions), and hence the uImage doesn't need to be loaded to or
moved to any particular location.

The scripts that U-Boot runs determine where the image gets loaded into
memory.

Not everyone agrees with this.

No. The last time I heard anyone talk about that, it sounded like the
adoption was basically zero, so it seems pointless. Personally, I find
creating that kind of image more complex, and don't see any benefits in
that format either.

U-Boot does not currently have the ability to boot zImage on ARM.

But that is irrelevant for the people who are using U-Boot not grub.
