For this last one, I don't think this is achievable since if I store the
vfio_platform_irq in the opaque, it matches irqs[i] of
vfio_platform_device and I don't have any mean to retrieve "i" when
calling container_of.


	struct vfio_platform_irq *irq =
		container_of(prod, struct vfio_platform_irq, producer);
	struct vfio_platform_device *vpdev =
		container_of(irq, struct vfio_platform_device,  irqs[i?]);


struct vfio_platform_device {
../..
        struct vfio_platform_irq        *irqs;
../..
}
So I think I still need to pass vfio_platform_device in the opaque and
look on irqs array to identify the right vfio_platform_irq *.

Do I miss sthg?
