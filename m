The problematic commit is 963fcd4, because it calls gic_enable_sre()
in the host kernel even with a GICv2 DT specified, and this seems to
put things in a state such that we don't receive virtual timer
interrupts in the guest when we boot it up.  (I'm not that familiar with
the QEMU DT but it is providing a GIC v2 to the guest.)

With a v4.5-rc1 host, if I "return false" before the code in gic_enable_sre()
that tries to actually enable the SRE, and then hardcode the
__vgic_v2_XXX_state() save/restore calls into the __vgic_XXX_state()
routines, then my guest boots up OK.

We are using a modified ARM version of EDK v3.0-rc0, and a modified
ARM Trusted Firmware based on commit 963fcd4 (between v1.1 and 1.2).
We certainly haven't touched any of the GIC code in either one.

I tried to modify the host DT to enable GICv3, but then the host itself
hangs on boot, so clearly more is needed.  (To be fair I've only tested
v4.4 in that configuration, not v4.5-rc1.)  The firmware isn't yet using
GICv3 so perhaps that is part of the problem.
