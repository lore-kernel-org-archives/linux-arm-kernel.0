Hi Mark,

Could you please give us some information about the impact to 
performance to help us evaluating

the influence to the system?

Thanks a lot.


Best Regards

> Extension Overview
> ==================
>
> The ARMv8.3 pointer authentication extension adds functionality to detect
> modification of pointer values, mitigating certain classes of attack such as
> stack smashing, and making return oriented programming attacks harder
>
> The extension introduces the concept of a pointer authentication code (PAC),
> which is stored in some upper bits of pointers. Each PAC is derived from the
> original pointer, another 64-bit value (e.g. the stack pointer), and a secret
> 128-bit key.
>
> New instructions are added which can be used to:
>
> * Insert a PAC into a pointer
> * Strip a PAC from a pointer
> * Authenticate strip a PAC from a pointer
>
> If authentication succeeds, the code is removed, yielding the original pointer.
> If authentication fails, bits are set in the pointer such that it is guaranteed
> to cause a fault if used.
>
> These instructions can make use of four keys:
>
> * APIAKey (A.K.A. Instruction A key)
> * APIBKey (A.K.A. Instruction B key)
> * APDAKey (A.K.A. Data A key)
> * APDBKey (A.K.A. Data B Key)
>
> A subset of these instruction encodings have been allocated from the HINT
> space, and will operate as NOPs on any ARMv8 parts which do not feature the
> extension (or if purposefully disabled by the kernel). Software using only this
> subset of the instructions should function correctly on all ARMv8-A parts.
>
> Additionally, instructions are added to authenticate small blocks of memory in
> similar fashion, using APGAKey (A.K.A. Generic key).
>
>
> This Series
> ===========
>
> This series enables the use of instructions using APIAKey, which is initialised
> and maintained per-process (shared by all threads). This series does not add
> support for APIBKey, APDAKey, APDBKey, nor APGAKey. The series only supports
> the use of an architected algorithm.
>
> I've given this some basic testing with a homebrew test suite. More ideally,
> we'd add some tests to the kernel source tree.
>
> I've added some basic KVM support, but this doesn't cater for systems with
> mismatched support. Looking forward, we'll need ID register emulation in KVM so
> that we can hide features from guests to cater for such cases.
>
>
> Open questions
> ==============
>
> * Should keys be per-thread rather than per-process?
>
>    My understanding is that glibc can't (currently) handle threads having
>    different keys, but it might be that another libc would prefer per-thread
>    keys. If desired, we could add a mechanism for a thread to re-initialize its
>    keys without an exec*().
>
> * Do we need a separate hwcap for XPAC* instructions?
>
>    Library code performing stack unwinding may need to interoperate with other
>    code which may or may not be using pointer authentication. It may be
>    desirable to use XPAC* rather than attempting authentication and/or acquiring
>    the PAC masks via ptrace.
>
>    As we may expose APIBKey (potentially separately from APIAKey) in future,
>    HWCAP_APIA cannot be used to determine when these instruction can/should be
>    used.
>
> * Should we expose a per-process data key now, to go with the insn key?
>
>    I don't currently have a use-case for this.
>
> * Should we expose generic authentication (i.e. APGAKey)?
>
>    I don't currently have a use-case for this.
>
> * Should the kernel remove PACs when unwinding user stacks?
>
>    This is simple to do, but it's arguably placing a policy in the kernel as to
>    what we expect user stacks to look like. Regardless, userspace will have to
>    perform this when unwinding with DWARF.
