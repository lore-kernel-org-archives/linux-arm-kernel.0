OK reading again "[PATCH v7 7/8] KVM: arm/arm64: Provide a
get_input_level for the arch timer", I now understand it works because
we had the
kvm_timer_sync_hwstate toggling down the line on VM exit. After the
changes of next patch this can be safely removed.

Not related to this patch but I noticed
Documentation/virtual/kvm/arm/vgic-mapped-irqs.txt now is outdated.
