Subject: [PATCH v1 08/16] kvm: arm/arm64: Clean up stage2 pgd life time
In-Reply-To: <20180109190414.4017-1-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>
References: <20180109190414.4017-1-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>
Message-ID: <20180109190414.4017-9-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

On arm/arm64 we pre-allocate the entry level page tables when
a VM is created and is free'd when either all the mm users are
gone or the KVM is about to get destroyed. i.e, kvm_free_stage2_pgd
is triggered via kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all() which can be invoked
from two different paths :

 1) do_exit()-> .-> mmu_notifier->release()-> ..-> kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all()
    OR
 2) kvm_destroy_vm()-> mmu_notifier_unregister-> kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all()

This has created lot of race conditions in the past as some of
the VCPUs could be active when we free the stage2 via path (1).

On a closer look, all we need to do with kvm_arch_flush_shadow_all() is,
to ensure that the stage2 mappings are cleared. This doesn't mean we
have to free up the stage2 entry level page tables yet, which could
be delayed until the kvm is destroyed. This would avoid issues
of use-after-free, as we don't free the page tables and anyone who
tries to access the page table would find them in the appropriate
state (mapped vs unmapped), as the page table modifications are
serialised via kvm->mmu_lock. This will be later used for delaying
the allocation of the stage2 entry level page tables until we really
need to do something with it.
