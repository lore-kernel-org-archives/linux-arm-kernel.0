I forwarded a copy of the initial posting of all 20 patches to you.

I think the documentation above does contain the critical facts that:

  - Accesses to PCI config space and PCI I/O port space should be
    non-posted

  - ARM64 currently maps them as posted, which may cause ordering
    problems

It's possible the changelog could be made clearer by *removing* text,
but I'm not sure what Lorenzo could *add* to make it better.

This particular patch is generic (not ARM64-specific), so maybe all we
need to say here is that PCI requires non-posted mappings in some
cases, and we currently don't have a generic ioremap() to make them,
so we're adding a way for an arch to provide such an interface.
