Hi Suzuki,

ubuntu at arm64:~$ uname -a
Linux arm64 4.5.0-rc5-00019-g3e330b9 #76 SMP PREEMPT Wed Mar 2 17:46:57 MSK 2016 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux

ubuntu at arm64:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo
processor       : 0-47
BogoMIPS        : 200.00
Features        : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32 atomics
CPU implementer : 0x43
CPU architecture: 8
CPU variant     : 0x1
CPU part        : 0x0a1
CPU revision    : 0

ubuntu at arm64:~$ file readdir
readdir: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32,
BuildID[sha1]=aeebc12494450b55a2ab0d39ebd2e121e9085d5c, not stripped

W/o 32_EL0:
ubuntu at arm64:~$ ./readdir 
-bash: ./readdir: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

With 32_ELO but w/o your patchset: kernel just hangs (on 4.2 it
printed errors, but it was other machine);

With 32_EL0 and with your patchset:
ubuntu at arm64:~$ ./readdir 
-bash: ./readdir: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error

So, everything is looking OK.

Yury.
