Subject: [PATCH v6 00/15] KVM: arm64: Optimise FPSIMD context switching
Message-ID: <1525797900-5548-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Note: Most of these patches are Arm-specific.  People not Cc'd on the
whole series can find it in the linux-arm-kernel archive [3].

This series aims to improve the way FPSIMD context is handled by KVM.
Only minor changes have been made since the previous v5 [1].
The changes are summarised in the individual patches.

Patch 6 is new, and does some simple refactoring to enable new bits to
be added to an existing vcpu_arch flags field.

Patches 1, 2, 6, 7 and 14 are still missing Reviewed-bys/Acked-bys, so
reviewer attention on these patches would be much appreciated.


Some testing done on Juno and the Arm fast model (arm64), including
(on earlier versions of the patches) combinations of (non-)SVE and
(non-)VHE configurations.

Cheers
