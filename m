that's what I wonder; if perf itself reserves a counter for example,
then we'll at best be able to measure with N-1 counters for the guest (N
being the number of counters on the physical CPU), so why tell the guest
we have N counters?

Of course, we can never even be guaranteed to have N-1 counters
avaialable either, so maybe the sane choice is just to tell the guest
what kind of hardware we have, and then fiddle the best we can with the
remaining counters?  After all, correct functionality of the guest
doesn't depend on this, it's a best-effort kind of thing...

Thoughts?

That depends on the way the counters are used by perf I think.  What if
you have system wide events?  What if the KVM (vcpu) process itself is
being monitored for some events?

I think the point is that you cannot use the same value of r->reg to
index into both arrays, so the cp15 index must be passed from the
cp15_regs array first.
