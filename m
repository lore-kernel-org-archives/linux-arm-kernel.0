Thanks. You've just been wasting everybody's time for two days. In case
you haven't noticed, mainline KVM code is the *ONLY* thing we care about.

I really cannot think of a good reason why we'd want to do that. Playing
with set_fs() is almost universally wrong, and I'm certainly going to
oppose to any change in that area unless the code that calls set_fs()
has been made public and properly reviewed. Until then, UAO/PAN will
stay as they are unless you prove that our current code is wrong.
