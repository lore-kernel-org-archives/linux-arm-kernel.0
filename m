If we do this, I guess there is no need to check for
xen_initial_domain() in the get_arch_dma_ops() function. Anyway, this
hunk would break the other architectures since xen_dma_ops is only
defined for arm and arm64.

A different hack would be to avoid the generic get_dma_ops
implementation on arm with some #ifdef hacks above.

Yet another way would be for dom0 to always set dev->dma_ops to
xen_dma_ops and preserve the real dma_ops somewhere under dev->archdata.
You could intercept the arch_setup_dma_ops() function for this or use
bus_register_notifier() (though I think the former is easier). The Xen
code making use of the real dma_ops would have to dig them out from
dev->archdata.
