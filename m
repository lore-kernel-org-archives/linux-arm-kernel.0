what is the expected sequence of operations.  For example, to restore
the ITS, do I call KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT first, then restore all
the memory and registers, and finally call KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_RESTORE_TABLES?

Is there any interaction between when you call KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_RESTORE_TABLES
and restore GITS_CTLR (which enables the ITS)?

It may be helpful to state the ordering requirements somewhere:

Restoring the ITS:
------------------
Restoring the ITS requires certain things to happen in order.
Specifically:
 1. Initialize the ITS (KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT)
 2. Restore GITS_IIDR
 3. Restore GITS_CBASER
 4. Restore GITS_READR
 5. Restore remainin registers except GITS_CTLR
 6. Make sure all guest memory is restored
 7. Load the ITS table data (KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_RESTORE_TABLES)

I assume the B here is bytes.  Where does this requirement come from?

deviceid or eventid?
