We don't always check the exception table for a dedicated uaccess. The
only cases where the exception table is checked is when
down_read_trylock(mmap_sem) fails or CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is enabled. This is
a slight optimisation of the fast path of the page fault handling. So,
without is_permission_fault() (which much quicker than
search_exception_tables()) the kernel would keep restarting the same
instruction.

It actually sets the PAN bit in regs->pstate when it sees the reserved
ASID.

The EFI runtime services use a non-reserved ASID, so a fault taken while
executing EFI services would clear the PAN bit in regs->pstate. Such
faults would not trigger is_permission_fault() == true above.

We don't normally expect faults on those paths. If we get one, they are
usually fatal, so the kernel still dies but with a slightly misleading
message.

We could improve this I think if we can distinguished between
reserved_ttbr0 after swapper (set on exception entry) and the reserved
TTBR0_EL1 pointing to empty_zero_page (and not merging Ard's patch). Is
it worth having such distinction? I'm not convinced, the only thing you
probably save is not printing "Accessing user space memory outside
uaccess.h routines" during fault (there may be other ways to mark these
special cases maybe by checking the current thread_info but it needs
more thinking).
