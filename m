Perhaps I am just trying to confuse you and myself ;)

But,

Yes. But see above. ACCESS_ONCE is sufficient if we read the first filter
installed by another thread, in this case rmb() pairs with mb_before_atomic()
before set_bit(TIF_SECCOMP).

IOW, if this threads sees TIF_SECCOMP, it should also see all modifications
which were done before set_bit, including the data in ->filter points to.

Yes, it is fine if we miss yet another filter which was just installed by
another thread.

But, unless I missed something, the problem is that we can get this new
filter.

Just to simplify. Suppose TIF_SECCOMP was set a long ago. This thread
has a single filter F1 and it enters seccomp_run_filters().

Right before it does ACCESS_ONCE() to read the pointer, another thread
does seccomp_sync_threads() and sets .filter = F2.

If ACCESS_ONCE() returns F1 - everything is fine. But it can see the new
pointer F2, and in this case we need a barrier to ensure that, say,
LOAD(F2->prog) will see all the preceding changes in this memory.

Oleg.
