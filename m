Subject: [PATCH] arm/arm64: KVM: Handle out-of-RAM cache maintenance as a NOP
Message-ID: <1454942245-18452-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

So far, our handling of cache maintenance by VA has been pretty
simple: Either the access is in the guest RAM and generates a S2
fault, which results in the page being mapped RW, or we go down
the io_mem_abort() path, and nuke the guest.

The first one is fine, but the second one is extremely weird.
Treating the CM as an I/O is wrong, and nothing in the ARM ARM
indicates that we should generate a fault for something that
cannot end-up in the cache anyway (even if the guest maps it,
it will keep on faulting at stage-2 for emulation).

So let's just skip this instruction, and let the guest get away
with it.
