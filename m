Looks like you have unearthed a very long standing (though not fatal)
bug - I can trace it back to 2005 and the inclusion of the Realview
support (see include/asm-arm/arch-realview/entry-macro.S in 8ad68bbf for
the details).

It may be that the original GIC didn't make number 1020 a special one,
though the earliest spec I have access to (GICv1) is already making 1020
a reserved interrupt number. And looking@the pre-existing code
(arch/arm/common/gic.c), 1020 seems to already be considered an invalid
number.

CC-ing Catalin, as he was the one who introduced it... ;-) Unless he
says otherwise, I'll cook a patch for that.

Because I wrote the GICv3 code with my paranoia hat on... This really
should never fail.

This is indeed related. For a GIC to support EOIMode==1, you need to
have access to the DIR register, which has the good idea of being
located on a separate 4k page, making the size of the CPU interface 8k
in total. Anything smaller means you don't have a DIR register.

It is worth noticing that most of the DTS files containing a reference
to GICv2 are wrong, and are only exposing a 4k CPU interface. These
platforms won't be able to use this feature until they are fixed.
Basically anything with an A7/A15/A53/A57/X-Gene.

Thanks,

	M.
