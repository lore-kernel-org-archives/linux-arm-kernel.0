Does this happen often enough to be worth micro-optimising?
With the code as written we read and then writeback the cond
field into the cpsr most of the time, which you could avoid by
doing the "done with the IT block?" check early:
    if (!(cpsr & 0x06000c00)) {
        cpsr &= ~COMPAT_PSR_IT_MASK;
        return;
    }

I guess the compiler is smart enough to notice that the "& 0x1f"
can be dropped.
