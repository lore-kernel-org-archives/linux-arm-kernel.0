Right. The OMAP1 Amstrad Delta is a somewhat obscure machine, and that
would be the most likely candidate to run into this.

RiscPC also has FIQ support, but I have not heard of anyone other
than Russell still using one with a modern kernel, and I doubt he
tests linux-next on it.

The s3c24xx and imx machines that could use FIQ probably don't
use it in practice, last time I checked, I didn't see any DTS file
or platform data definition in the kernel that activated that
code path.

Good enough for now, but it may be worth revisiting this, as the
vector page might be a good target for an attack if you have a
way to overwrite a few bytes in the kernel.

Note that there are two mappings for the pages, and as Russell
mentioned, the TLS emulation writes to the other one that is
at a fixed virtual address.

It might be better to start by making the fixed mapping readonly,
as KASLR doesn't protect that one at all, and change the TLS
code accordingly.
