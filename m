Snazzy!

Hmm, maybe. When we exit the guest its because we've had a notification an error
occurred, but we don't know what/where yet. The case that worries me is we
reschedule() onto some other affected task, and it gets notification of the
error too.

For notifications signalled by an SError I'd like to feed them into the RAS
machinery before we unmask SError on the host, so that the first error is
handled first. Otherwise KVM has to eyeball the SError ESR and guess as to
whether the host is affected by the error, before re-enabling preemption on the
grounds it 'probably only affects this guest'.

(sorry, I assume not everyone reads the cover letter!)

Yes, it was a dead end. I figured two handle_exit()s was a bit ugly, I assumed
you were asking about moving back to a single handle_exit()...

My justification for this sort of thing has been we've taken an SError, we may
panic() the host if its uncontained. Provided there is no extra cost on the 'no
SError' path, I don't think the 'we've taken an SError' paths need to be fast.

I'll keep this in mind.

Yes, and that would have been a better name!
