I returned to this and see that the problem was indeed me. I needed yet
another enable bit set (the filter register needed to be instructed to
count cycles while in el2). I've attached the code for the curious.
The numbers are mean=6999, std_dev=242. Run on the host, or in a guest
running on a host without this patch series (after TVM traps have been
disabled), I get a pretty consistent 40.

I checked how many vm-sysreg traps we do during the kernel compile
benchmark. It's 124924. So it's a bit strange that we don't see the
benchmark taking 10 to 20 seconds longer on average. I should probably
double check my runs. In any case, while I like the approach of this
series, the overhead is looking non-negligible.
