Laura, thanks for your work!

I've reviewed and tested this patch on my LeMaker HiKey board (HiSilicon Kirin
620 SoC). The lkdtm tests for STACKLEAK work fine.

Acked-by: Alexander Popov <alex.popov@linux.com>

For testing I applied your patches above Kees' for-next/kspp:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kees/linux.git/log/?h=for-next/kspp

I've had one trouble with building CONFIG_STACKLEAK_RUNTIME_DISABLE on arm64.
Kees, could you please fold this into the 7th patch of the series?
