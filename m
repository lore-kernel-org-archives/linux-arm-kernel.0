I agree, hence this RFC.

The key question is how we fix the arm64 /proc/cpuinfo format to make
those programs function, without potentially breaking other
applications.

Yes. We made a mistake here with the arm64 format. Hopefully there's a
way by which we can keep applications happy.

For future architectures, it's probably worth putting stronger
guidelines in place to prevent precisely the issues we've hit here.

Mark.
