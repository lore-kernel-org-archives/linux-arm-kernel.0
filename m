Indeed, in fact the comment is confusing the way it explain things. It suggests that
some CPUs maybe doing context tracking while some other can choose not to context track.

It's rather all or nothing. Actually TIF_NOHZ optimize systems that have CONFIG_CONTEXT_TRACKING=y
and that don't need context tracking. In this case TIF_NOHZ is cleared and thus the syscall
fastpath has no overhead.

So I should rephrase it that way:

        * The context tracking uses the syscall slow path to implement its user-kernel
        * boundaries probes on syscalls. This way it doesn't impact the syscall fast
        * path when context tracking is globally disabled.

That is indeed a stale comment from aborted early design.

Right, that would be much better. Good catch! context tracking is enabled from
tick_nohz_init(). This is the init 0 task so the flag should be propagated from there.

I still think we need a for_each_process_thread() set as well though because some
kernel threads may well have been created at this stage already.

I'm not sure I understand your question. Context tracking is either enabled everywhere or
nowhere.

I need to say though that there is a per CPU context tracking state named context_tracking.active.
It's confusing because it suggests that context tracking is active per CPU. Actually it's tracked
everywhere when globally enabled, but active determines if we call the RCU and vtime callbacks or
not.

So only nohz full CPUs have context_tracking.active set because only these need to call the RCU
and vtime callbacks. Other CPUs still do the context tracking but they won't call rcu and vtime
functions.
