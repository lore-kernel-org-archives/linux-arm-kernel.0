It ended up here because there is a Makefile target, Image.gz, though I
haven't used it at all. I'll expand the text so that it is not
restricted to gzip.

Yes.

At least the latter case is used on the model. For the other cases, it's
quite early to clearly specify what is needed as we don't currently have
a boot-loader other than UEFI. We may expect GRUB as well.
