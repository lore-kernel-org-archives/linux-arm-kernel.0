Indeed, and that's the point where I'm starting to think that we may be
trying to beautify something that may not be worth it.

That's my point above. The only use case we have so far for this method
is to take over EL2. On the other have, I've noticed that the more I
rework this area, the more old stuff surfaces, ready to be nuked. Maybe
I should keep digging.

What I can do is prepare an extra series that would include the
corresponding 32bit changes, and we then evaluate that separately. I
don't mind spending a bit of time on it.

Thanks,
