I'm not sure you can safely assume this for time related things, unless
you can guarantee that all vcpus are stopped. Claudio is seeing time
jumping in weird ways, and so have I, which would tend to show that QEMU
is introducing some jitter.

Maybe not easily observable on real hardware, but the FastModel is
enough to show the issue.

So unless someone has a better solution, I'm seriously considering
getting this patch merged.

Thanks,
