Sure, but someone working backward from finding the __copy_*, it's
less obvious. :)

My question is mainly: why not just use copy_*() everywhere instead?
Having these things so spread out makes it fragile, and there's very
little performance benefit from using __copy_*() over copy_*().

As far as I can see, everything looks correctly checked here, but it
took a while to convince myself of it. Having Dave's description in
the other reply certainly helped, though, thanks for that! :)
