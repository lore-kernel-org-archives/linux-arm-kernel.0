Ah, that would explain why I was just struggling to find it ;-)
Please note that the last parameters is a "size", which really means
"number of bits". That's different from GENMASK, which takes the last
valid bit.
Also there is "slight glitch" in the spec here:
The bit *diagram* for MAPD puts the last valid ITT address bit at 50,
but the text clearly speaks or [51:8], which also makes more sense.

Cheers,
Andre.
