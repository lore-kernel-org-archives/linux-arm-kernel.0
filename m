There are two ideas we discussed in the past (but never implemented
them obviously):

- instead of reading the "kaslr-seed" in the decompressor, it could
  simply hash all of the DT blob to get the seed. This way the bootloader
  can put the random see anywhere it likes, and as an added bonus,
  we also get a little bit more random behavior on machines that have
  no entropy source at all but that do have things like a serial number or
  mac address in DT. Obviously those would be constant across boots
  but different between machines. The OS can also store a random
  seed during shutdown in a location that the bootloader uses to
  initialize /chosen/kaslr-seed or another property that we use to seed
  the kernel PRNG at boot time.

- If we have a random number at boot but no way to pass it through
  the DT, I think we actually /can/ pass it through registers: the
  register state is undefined, so in the worst case using the XOR of
  all registers gives us the same number on each boot, but the
  if the loader is modified to store a random 32-bit number in any
  of the registers that don't pass other information, we can use that
  to calculate the kaslr-base.
