Like many of these things, there is no clear answer.  It's a set of
conflicting requirements, and as you point out, even if you've called
feenableexcept(), you are not guaranteed to get a trap.

However, do remember that FP exceptions on ARM hardware are already
asynchronous - they get reported by the _next_ FP operation to the one
that caused them, which means they could be raised by a library function
sometime after it occured (when the library function decides to save the
FP registers to the stack before it makes use of them.)  It's entirely
possible that the library function has blocked FP signals temporarily
(not explicitly, just decided to block all signals while it does
something sensitive) and will unblock them again afterwards - at which
point we get the SIGFPE, and it would be quite right to deliver that
signal to the user SIGFPE handler, rather than forcing it onto the
program mid-library function.

It's also possible that SIGFPE could be blocked by another signal handler
having been invoked, and it triggers the latent generation of the SIGFPE.

I'd be more inclined to agree with you if VFP exceptions were synchronous
but they aren't.

I don't recall.
