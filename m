Yeah, that's worth exploring, but given the shenanigans around
set_fs(), I'd like to leave this as-is, and we can add to these checks
as we remove as much of the insane usage of set_fs().

Hm, interesting. That's a very small check to add. My knee-jerk is to
just leave it up to page protection. I'm on the fence. :)

Oh, interesting! Yeah, would you be willing to put together that patch
and test it? I wonder if there are any cases where there are
legitimate usercopys across multiple symbols.

I don't want to start with an exemption here, so until such a case is
found, I'd rather leave this as-is. That said, the primary protection
here tends to be buggy lengths (which is why put/get_user() is
untouched). For constant-sized copies, some checks could be skipped.
In the second part of this protection (what I named
CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY_WHITELIST in the RFC version of this series),
there are cases where we want to skip the whitelist checking since it
is for a constant-sized copy the code understands is okay to pull out
of an otherwise disallowed allocator object.
