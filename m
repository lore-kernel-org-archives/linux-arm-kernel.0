Since there appears to be more work needed in the PSCI/KVM changes
(patches 9 through 14), how about we go with the "bare-metal" parts:
patches 1-8 first and try to get those included ASAP?

The rationale being that a lot of affected people have Linux running on
ARMv7-A Cortex-A, typically A9, A15, Brahma-B15, and are in need of
those patches but do not necessarily require KVM fixes right now, and
even less so PSCI infrastructure to mitigate ARMv8-A running in AArch32.

In terms of backporting to -stable, and because the spectre variant 1
patches have not been submitted yet, it is not like we can lump
everything in one go anyway, so we are not making the lives of the
-stable maintainers any worse than it currently is?

Yay or nay?
