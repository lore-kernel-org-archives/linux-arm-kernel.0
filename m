The physical counter is always available right?  So why not just use the
physical counter?

I guess that comes down to two questions:

First, can get_cycles() be called from whereever in any context etc.?
In other words, is it ever called between vcpu_load() and vcpu_put(),
because if not, it doesn't matter which one we use, but that may be a
slightly brittle solution.

Second, what should the semantics of get_cycles be?  Is it important
it's synchronized with the counter backing the timer being used, or
should it rather represents a wall-clock cycle measure, or should it
indeed represent virtual cycles spent if we ever decide to start
tweaking the offset depending on stolen cycles?

Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself and we should just make sure it's
aligned with the timer in use, in which case we only have to decide if
we should implement that by (a) setting a function pointer, (b) using an
alternative, or (c) using a static key :)

Thanks,
