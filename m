Hmmm, "that that".  I'll fix that.

Looking at this again, I think it is poorly worded.  This patch aims to
make it true by construction, but it isn't prior to the patch.

I'm tempted to delete the paragraph: the assertion of both untrue and
not the best way to justify that this patch works.


How about:

-8<-

The context switch logic already isolates user threads from each other.
This, it is sufficient for isolating user threads from the kernel,
since the goal either way is to ensure that code executing in userspace
cannot see any FPSIMD state except its own.  Thus, there is no special
property of kernel threads that we care about except that it is
pointless to save or load FPSIMD register state for them.

At worst, the removal of all the kernel thread special cases by this
patch would thus spuriously load and save state for kernel threads when
unnecessary.

But the context switch logic is already deliberately optimised to defer
reloads of the regs until ret_to_user (or sigreturn as a special case),
which kernel threads by definition never reach.

->8-


As an aside, I notice that we allow thread.fpsimd_cpu to be initialised
to 0 for the init task.  This means that the wrong_cpu check may yield
false for the init task when it shouldn't, because the init task's
FPSIMD state (which doesn't logically exist) is never loaded anywhere.
But the wrong_task check will always yield true for the init task for
the same reason, so this is just an inconsistency in the code rather
than a bug AFAICT.

copy_thread() calls fpsimd_flush_task_state() to make sure that
wrong_cpu is initially true for new tasks.  We should do the same for
the init task by adding

	.fpsimd_cpu = NR_CPUS,

to INIT_THREAD.
