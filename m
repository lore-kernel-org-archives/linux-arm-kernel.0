On flush vgic_its_check_id does the 2 stage handling and computes the
entry address from the devid:

		if (!vgic_its_check_id(its, baser,
				       dev->device_id, &eaddr))

Then you simply flush the entry at that address

On restore, you need to scan the level1 and level2 tables for valid entries.

Yes this should be 19 bits

Those 40 bits match [47:8] of the itt_addr. I limited to 48 since I
found a comment saying
/*
 * We only implement 48 bits of PA at the moment, although the ITS
 * supports more. Let's be restrictive here.
 */


On the other hand there is
#define its_cmd_get_ittaddr(cmd) its_cmd_mask_field(cmd, 2,  8, 44)
To me this is wrong. I would have expected its_cmd_mask_field(cmd, 2,
8, 47) instead as the other *_ADDRESS()

If confirmed I will send a fix.

thanks a lot for your time and the numerous bugs you found!
