Yes. See arch/arm64/kernel/cpu-reset.S for example, where the macro is
used to clear all these flags in one go. SCTLR_EL1.A was never set the
first place (it was cleared at boot time in __cpu_setup).

We could remove the A bit from SCTLR_ELx_FLAGS altogether, and it
wouldn't have any observable effect (or so I believe). This would be
another way to fix this problem.

OK.

Thanks,
