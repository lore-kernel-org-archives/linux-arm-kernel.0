Is that the physical address space on the host, or the physical
address space size we present to the guest?

Isn't it likely to confuse the guest if we lie to it about the PA range it
sees? When would the two values differ?

Do we also need a 'set' operation, so userspace can create a VM
that has a 40 bit userspace on a CPU that supports more than that,
or does it just work?

What's the x86 API for KVM to tell userspace about physical address
range restrictions?
