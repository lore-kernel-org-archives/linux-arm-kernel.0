Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Stackleak for arm64

This is an extension of the arm64 stackleak plugin, based on top of the
v11 version for x86. The biggest change from the previous version is the
conversion from assembly to C. It's mostly taken straight from the x86
version modulo a few cleanups and seems to work just fine. If this gets
Acks, I'd like Kees to start carrying in his tree for -next.
