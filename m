Do you agree KVM does this today?
ddb3d07cfe90 ("arm64: KVM: Inject a Virtual SError if it was pending")

All I've changed here is that you don't get a RAS error passed into the guest.
Its either deemed non-blocking and ignored, or we kick the guest with an impdef
SError.

To do any better we need kernel first support, or a firmware first notification.


> I know your meaning that An all-zero SError means Uncategorized

Uncategorized RAS error. RAS errors should be handled by the host, we should not
inject them into the guest on a path like this.

Which impdef ESR would you like to use, and why does it matter?

For RAS events it generated all by itself, or was notified by the kernel using
signals.

This is not one of those cases. But that's fine as we aren't injecting a RAS error.

I can't work out what you're saying here.

If you're suggesting Qemu should set a default 'unknown' ESR for use when KVM
doesn't know what to do, and SError is pretty much its only option:

Why would Qemu set anything other than impdef:all-zeros?

The only use would be to fake this back into a RAS error. Qemu isn't involved
here so this can't be used to emulate NOTIFY_SEI without the kernel support. We
don't have support for emulating the RAS ERR registers either, so this can't be
used to emulate kernel first.


If you're suggesting Qemu should specify a set of ESR values for the different
cases where KVM doesn't know what do: this would be an early shortcut that burns
us in the future, these things are going to be changed. This is too specific to
KVMs internals:

When we add NOTIFY_SEI support, we will call out of this KVM code and APEI
should 'claim' any SError that arrived with CPER records.

I expect this code to change dramatically if/when we add kernel first support.


The KVM patches on the end of this series are just the minimum needed to enable
IESB and keep the status quo for all other behaviour. And this is just so we can
tackle the other bits of support that depends on the cpufeature without
reposting all the same code.
