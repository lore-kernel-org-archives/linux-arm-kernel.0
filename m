Subject: [PATCHv2 00/15] arm64: 16K translation granule support
Message-ID: <1442331684-28818-1-git-send-email-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

This series enables the 16K page size support on Linux for arm64.
Adds support for 48bit VA(4 level), 47bit VA(3 level) and
36bit VA(2 level) with 16K. 16K was a late addition to the architecture
and is not implemented by all CPUs. Added a check to ensure the
selected granule size is supported by the CPU, failing which the CPU
won't proceed with booting. Also the kernel page size is added to the
kernel image header (patch from Ard).

KVM bits have been tested on a fast model with GICv3 using kvmtool [1].

Patches 1-7	cleans up the kernel page size handling code.
Patch 8		Adds a check to ensure the CPU supports the selected granule size.
Patch 9		Adds the page size information to image header.
Patches 10-13	Fixes some issues with the KVM bits, mainly the fake PGD
             	handling code.
Patches 14-15	Adds the 16k page size support bits.

This series applies on top of 4.3-rc1.

The tree is also available here:

        git://linux-arm.org/linux-skp.git  16k/v2-4.3-rc1

Changes since V1:
  - Rebase to 4.3-rc1
  - Fix vmemmap_populate for 16K (use !ARM64_SWAPPER_USES_SECTION_MAPS)
  - Better description for patch2 (suggested-by: Ard)
  - Add page size information to the image header flags.
  - Added reviewed-by/tested-by Ard.
