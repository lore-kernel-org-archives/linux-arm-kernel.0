Ok, thanks for James's confirmation.

Another question, For the SEI, I want to also use SIGBUS both for the KVM user and non-kvm user, if SEA and SEI Error all use the SIGBUS to notify user space(Qemu),
the user space(Qemu) will be confused, and do not know whether this is SEA or SEI error. so here I pass the sysreg ESR_EL2(vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2) to the user space, let user space judges the (vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2)'s value
to know this is a SEA or SEI Error. do you agree my solution for the SEI? thanks.

because the vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 can not directly passed to userspace, so I defined the vcpu->arch.fault.esr_el2 to sysreg ESR_EL2/FAR_EL2, sysreg register can pass to user space.


+		vcpu_sys_reg(vcpu,ESR_EL2) = kvm_vcpu_get_hsr(vcpu);
+		vcpu_sys_reg(vcpu,FAR_EL2) = kvm_vcpu_get_hfar(vcpu);

 thanks, so how about the SEA's error FAR_EL1's value? may be FAR_EL1's value get from FAR_EL2's value.
