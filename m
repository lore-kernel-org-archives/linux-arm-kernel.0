Pulled, but what made you change the GPG key into a revoked one?

  # gpg: Signature made Thu 09 Mar 2017 10:36:07 AM CET
  # gpg:                using RSA key AB309C74B93B1EA1
  # gpg: Good signature from "Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>"
  # gpg: WARNING: This key has been revoked by its owner!
  # gpg:          This could mean that the signature is forged.
  # gpg: reason for revocation: Key has been compromised
  # gpg: revocation comment: Revoked after kernel.org hacking
  # Primary key fingerprint: 6958 C9F2 233C 5E9D 6CCA  818A AB30 9C74 B93B 1EA1

Thanks.
