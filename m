Thanks for putting this together. If nothing else, this work needed a
good kick.

I had some rought comments on this, but in the process of wiring those
up, I ended up writing an alternative [1] by cobblnig together prior
attempts. Apologies for the NIH.

This sounds useful, but it's liable to fill a scrollbuffer and/or take a
while to dump (especially with 64K stacks), so we might want a boot-time
option to turn that on/off. 

Thanks,
Mark.
