The commit message is fine, I just think it would be nice to have it in 
the code so you don't have to look for the commit to understand.

Probably not, just personal preference I guess.

Hmmm, from my understanding they do, but the action the vcpu can be 
immediate or deferred. But from the semantics you give to 
IMMEDIATE/DEFERRABLE, I'd say the actions are related to vcpu.

I don't know if that makes sense.

I like that suggestion, very easy to follow. Of course negative side is 
that you'll need two of those switch... But yes I still prefer this new 
suggestion.

So if you go with this you can ignore my other comments ;) .
