Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Prevent VGIC_ADDR_TO_INTID from emiting
 divisions
Message-ID: <20161029111901.16668-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Using non-constant number of bits for VGIC_ADDR_TO_INTID() leads
to gcc 6.1 emiting calls to __aeabi_uldivmod, which the kernel
does not implement.

As we really don't want to implement complex division in the kernel,
the only other option is to prove to the compiler that there is only
a few values that are possible for the number of bits per IRQ, and
that they are all power of 2.

We turn the VGIC_ADDR_TO_INTID macro into a switch that looks for
the supported set of values (1, 2, 8, 64), and perform the computation
accordingly. When "bits" is a constant, the compiler optimizes
away the other cases. If not, we end-up with a small number of cases
that GCC optimises reasonably well. Out of range values are detected
both at build time (constants) and at run time (variables).

This should be applied *before* Andre's patch fixing out of bound SPIs.
