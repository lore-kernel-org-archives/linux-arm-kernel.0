Subject: [PATCH V3 1/2] PCI: Try to clean up resources via remove if shutdown
 doesn't exist
Message-ID: <1527542471-10316-1-git-send-email-okaya@codeaurora.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

It is up to a driver to implement shutdown() callback. If shutdown()
callback is not implemented, PCI device can have pending interrupt and
even do DMA transactions while the system is going down.

If kexec is in use, this can damage the newly booting kexec kernel
or even prevent it from booting altogether. Fallback to calling the
remove() callback if shutdown() isn't implemented for a given driver.
