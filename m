Honestly this has been confusing and I'm forgetting the history, but I
think it currently serves the purpose that code shared between v2 and v3
can look at vgic_vmcr.bpr in some canonical format that works for both
v2 and v3.  Originally I think the ctlr field only contained the bits
that then had the common bit position between v2 and v3.

A comment will help, and someone taking a look at reworking it to be
more clear would also be welcome.

But the currently code (incl this patch) looks right to me at this
point.
