I wonder if enough other architectures would be able to benefit from this
for most/all of their non-RUN VCPU ioctls. If so, then maybe we should
consider doing something like

 int __vcpu_load(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
 {
    int cpu;

    cpu = get_cpu();
    preempt_notifier_register(&vcpu->preempt_notifier);
    kvm_arch_vcpu_load(vcpu, cpu);
    put_cpu();
    return 0;
 }
 int vcpu_load(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
 {
    if (mutex_lock_killable(&vcpu->mutex))
        return -EINTR;
    return __vcpu_load(vcpu);
 }

and the equivalent for vcpu_put.

Then just take the lock in kvm_vcpu_ioctl and leave it to the
kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_* functions to call __vcpu_load/__vcpu_put
if necessary.

Thanks,
