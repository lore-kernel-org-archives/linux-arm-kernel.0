There isn't anything that would prevent this. However, as in the stage 1
scenarios, explicitly writing a PTE as a result of a permission fault
should also mark the entry as accessed (young, either as the default
protection in PROT_DEFAULT or explicitly via pte_mkyoung).

Since the hardware never clears the AF bit automatically, there is no
information to lose in this race as long as the kvm_set_s2pte_writable()
sets the AF bit. AFAICT, the PAGE_S2 and PAGE_S2_DEVICE definitions
already use PROT_DEFAULT which has the AF bit set.

Yes. I think "info gcc" isn't clear enough on this constraint (at least
to me) but that's something we learnt from the tools guys in the early
days of the aarch64 kernel port.
