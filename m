I'm not clear what you think the problem here for QEMU is.
We definitely want the API for the kernel to be:
 create device
 set attributes
 explicitly complete init of the device
 [attribute setting after this is illegal]
 run CPUs

so I'm not sure why QEMU would care if the kernel does things at
"final init" rather than "run CPUs".

This is how the GICv3 init works and how the ITS should work too;
we don't want to extend the GICv2 mistake of "no explicit complete
init" to anything else, because then you end up with ad-hoc
"do this when we first run the vCPU; oh, but also do it if
userspace tries to write a register content; and also if...".
