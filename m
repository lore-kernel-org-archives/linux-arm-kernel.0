I have changed the above comment to :

/*
  * The hardware supports concatenation of up to 16 tables at stage2 entry level
  * and we use the feature whenever possible.
  *
  * Now, the minimum number of bits resolved at any level is (PAGE_SHIFT - 3).
  * On arm64, the smallest PAGE_SIZE supported is 4k, which means
  *             (PAGE_SHIFT - 3) > 4 holds for all page sizes.
  * This implies, the total number of page table levels at stage2 expected
  * by the hardware is actually the number of levels required for (KVM_PHYS_SHIFT - 4)
  * in normal translations(e.g, stage1), since we cannot have another level in
  * the range (KVM_PHYS_SHIFT, KVM_PHYS_SHIFT - 4).

I have reworded the comment as follows:
/*
  * With all the supported VA_BITs and 40bit guest IPA, the following condition
  * is always true:
  *
  *       CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS >= STAGE2_PGTABLE_LEVELS
  *
  * We base our stage-2 page table walker helpers on this assumption and
  * fall back to using the host version of the helper wherever possible.
  * i.e, if a particular level is not folded (e.g, PUD) at stage2, we fall back
  * to using the host version, since it is guaranteed it is not folded at host.
  *
  * If the condition breaks in the future, we can rearrange the host level
  * definitions and reuse them for stage2. Till then...
  */
#if STAGE2_PGTABLE_LEVELS > CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS
#error "Unsupported combination of guest IPA and host VA_BITS."
#endif
