I'm happy to change this if you want -- it can be a __u64 without
impacting the semantics.

My rationale here related to the ucontext semantics associated with
the signal frame, rather than signal handling itself.

Consider:

void signal_handler(int n, siginfo_t *si, void *uc)
{
	*signal_context = *(ucontext_t *)uc;
}

Will this "work"?  On most machines, yes it will. 

With an expanded signal frame on arm64, it won't work: the copied
context will be truncated at the end of __reserved[].  If extra_data
uses an offset to locate the additional data then someone parsing
*signal_context won't be able to detect the error and will overrun:
this includes rt_sigreturn (if that is run on a stack that has the
copied context).

If a pointer is used in extra_context, this provides some chance of
handling this: naive code like the above will result in a ucontext_t
whose extra_context data pointer is "wrong": extra_context aware
parsers can detect that and error out or ignore the remaining data.
extra_context aware code that wants to copy the signal context can walk
the signal frame to determine its true size, allocate memory, copy, and
then update the extra_context data pointer in the new copy.

This isn't foolproof, but it at least gives us some protection.
