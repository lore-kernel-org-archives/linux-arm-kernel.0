Not just host/guest, but also those we can and can't handle.

KVM can't currently take an SError during world switch, so a RAS error that the
CPU was hoping to defer may spread from the host into KVM's
no-SError:world-switch code. If this happens it will (almost certainly) have to
be re-classified as uncontainable.

There is also a firmware-first angle here: NOTIFY_SEI can't be delivered if the
normal world has SError masked, so any error that spreads past this point
becomes a reboot-by-firmware instead of an OS notification and almost-helpful
error message.

We have IESB to run the error-barrier as we enter the guest. This would make any
host error pending as an SError, and we would exit the guest immediately. But if
there was an RAS error during world switch, by this point its likely to be
classified as uncontainable.

This esb() is trying to keep this window of code as small as possible, to just
errors that occur during world switch.

With your vcpu load/save this window becomes a lot smaller, it may be possible
to get a VHE-host's arch-code SError handler to take errors from EL2, in which
case this barrier can disappear.
(note to self: guest may still own the debug hardware)


Thanks,

James
