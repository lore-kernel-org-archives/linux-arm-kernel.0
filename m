Thanks for this, it was slightly unclear to me in which way kdump
different from the other cases, but makes sense now.

Just for clarity: I understood that Marc said he was willing to write
the code to support the common ABI that we agree on in KVM.  The fact
that he sent another small patch was a separate contribution, but that's
how I understood. it.

Nobody is arguing with the need for documentation, and I think I
understan the reason for needing to support a common ABI with a common
set of functions regardless of the logic in place in Hyp mode.

We just have to agree on a sane ABI and I'll be happy to help
write/review the API docs and clean things up.
