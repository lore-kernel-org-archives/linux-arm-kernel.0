Presently we are transferring data from interleaved memory tho 
contagious memory and vice-verse.
We can use the interleaved API for present scenario, but it will 
restrict the HW capability of transferring data from one interleaved 
pattern to other interleaved pattern.

We can use scatter gather but it will be extra burden on software to 
create those many SG list unlike in box mode just a single command 
serves the purpose.

Private parameter in our case will be command configuration parameter 
where we are passing information to HW like endianness, synchronization 
& acknowledge mechanism between DMA HW and peripherals running with 
different clock than DMA.

This parameter changes per each transfer.

We can see these possibilities to implement our DMA driver but still 
have to add new parameter in "scatterlist" & "interleaved template" for 
supporting per transfer private data like our command configuration 
parameter.

1.We have to add new parameter "struct data_chunk" in 
"interleaved_template" for supporting different destination pattern.
It helps a lot for implementing our total HW capability.

2.We have to use present API's for box mode.
--scatter gather API for different interleaved source & destination 
patterns.
--interleaved API for interleaved source pattern to destination 
contiguous pattern/vice-verse.
It causes some extra burden on our software to create sglist.

3.Implement New API for BOX mode.

I feel if we can go with first option then it helps a lot.

Please can you suggest a better way to solve our problem.

Thanks,
Ravi Kumar
