Hmmm, it looks like imprecise fp exception traps are disallowed from
ARMv8 onwards.  I guess they made more sense when the FPU really was a
coprocessor, or at least semidetached from the integer core.

I think force_sig_info() makes sense here if and only if the traps
are guaranteed to be precise, so we probably should use this on arm64.
Not arm though (alpha doesn't either, if I understand the code
correctly.)

Does that make sense?

Apparently, few recent cores (at least ARM's own ones) support fp
exception trapping anyway...  1176 may be the most recent.
