Effectively we only inject _pending_ IRQs: I was going forth and back
through the current code and couldn't find a place where we actually
make use of any active-only interrupt - the only exception being
migration, where we explicitly iterate through all LRs again and pick up
active-only IRQs as well. We never set the active state except there.

So I decided to keep only-active IRQs in the LRs and do not propagate
them back into the emulated distributor state. One reason is that we
don't use it, which makes the code look silly and secondly we avoid the
issue you described above.

We keep them as "queued" in our emulation until they become inactive and
we clear the queued bit in the EOI handler.

Admittedly this whole approach is not obvious and it's perfectly
possible that I missed something. So please can you check and confirm my
assumptions above?

Merci,
Andr?
