Looks good to me, I'll use that.

That's why I was implying here that RESET+SET is the safe way of doing
it. Another solution may be to make SET imply RESET, and keep it
implemented always?

Exactly. The current API doesn't try to cater for all possible cases. It
just make sure that KVM can be installed and torn down safely.

I'll use that when respinning it.
