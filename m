I'm not so sure about the host kernel configuration - after all, you
could have a very specialized host that doesn't use VFP at all
(softfloat), and yet offers VFP support to guests.

But what I'm worried about is the case where someone has built an
ARMv7+VE without VFP. We may end-up exploding in that case. What we
could do is to probe for the VFP HW, and not enable KVM if absent. This
would give us the freedom to remove the #ifdefery.

What do you think?
