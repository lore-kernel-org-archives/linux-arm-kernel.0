Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 00/23] KVM: arm64: Initial support for SVE guests
Message-ID: <1538141967-15375-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series implements basic support for allowing KVM guests to use the
Arm Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).

The patches are based on v4.19-rc5.

The patches are also available on a branch for reviewer convenience. [1]

This is a significant overhaul of the previous preliminary series [2],
with the major changes outlined below, and additional minor updates in
response to review feedback (see the individual patches for those).

In the interest of getting this series out for review, 
This series is **completely untested**.

Reviewers should focus on the proposed API (but any other comments are
of course welcome!)


Major changes:

 * Reworked on top of the new KVM FPSIMD context switching model.

 * Migrated away from use of feature bits in KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET /
   KVM_VCPU_INIT to detect and enable SVE support.

   Availability is now reported via KVM_CAP_ARM_SVE, and SVE support
   is enabled and configured per-vcpu with a new ioctl
   KVM_ARM_SVE_CONFIG.

 * KVM_ARM_SVE_CONFIG also adds the ability to detect and configure
   the set of SVE vector lengths provided to the guest.

 * The ioctl register access model has been simplified.  The new SVE
   interface must now be used to access the content of the FPSIMD
   V-registers, on SVE-enabled vcpus.  The kernel no longer tries to
   emulate the KVM_REG_ARM_CORE view for these registers in this case.
   (For non-SVE-enabled vcpus, the KVM_REG_ARM_CORE interface works as
   normal.)

 * Draft documentation for the SVE extensions has been added to KVM's
   api.txt.

Known issues:

 * KVM_GET_REG_LIST enumerates the FPSIMD V-registers for SVE-enabled
   vcpus.  It shouldn't, because attempts to access these will now fail!

 * kvmtool/qemu updates are needed to enable creation of SVE-enabled
   guests (to be discussed separately).

 * Due to heavy rework, the series is currently a bit of a mess: the
   patches are not presented in a very coherent order, and one or two
   patches may even now be redundant or irrelevant.  If you spot any
   obvious inconsistencies, please shout!
