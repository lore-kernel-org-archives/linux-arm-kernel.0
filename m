That won't help me for the interleaving behavior though.

Why doesn't any other architecture use assembly for their lpj code? They
may use headers with assembly in them or C code with assembly in them,
but they don't write all of the delay code in assembly and rely on
function interleaving. This leads me to believe other arches aren't
concerned about compiler optimizations breaking lpj cmdline parameters,
so why should ARM be concerned?

I tested the theory out and scaled down the CPU frequency to 19.2 MHz
and then called calibrate_delay(). Before and after applying this series
I got the same results.

Calibrating delay loop... 12.67 BogoMIPS (lpj=63360)

Jumping up to 1.2 GHz and calling calibrate_delay() gives me the same
before and after

Calibrating delay loop... 792.98 BogoMIPS (lpj=3964928)

I don't have access to a machine capable of running slower than 19.2
MHz. Maybe machines running in the KHz range would experience differences?
