So as suspected before, I think passing the "its" pointer here is wrong.
In fact you don't use that ITS except for getting the kvm pointer.
Architecturally the pending tables are per redistributor, so you should
pass a struct vcpu pointer.
So the cleanest way would be to have a FLUSH/RESTORE_PENDING_TABLE ioctl
on the *redistributor* kvm_device, which iterates through the list here
and just dumps the pending bits for LPIs targeting that VCPU (skipping
over others).
Alternatively it would be enough to pass just a struct kvm pointer here
and keep dumping all LPIs, but call this function only once per VM (not
for each ITS). That sounds a bit dodgy from the architectural point of
view, though.

As mentioned before I think this has to be reworked to take the lock,
copy the table, drop the lock again and then iterate over the (private)
copy to handle each LPI.
Or something completely different.
But IIRC the lpi_list_lock is taken completely independent of any ITS
emulation code in vgic.c.

Isn't target_vcpu == NULL a valid use case? So continue; instead of return?

Could deserve the comment that it doesn't actually scan the table for
set bits, but only checks the mapped LPIs (and thus should come last in
the restore process).
Also the same comment as above about using the "its" pointer applies here.

I believe this bit is only set once by software to communicate that
*initially* (upon enabling LPIs in the redistributor) the pending table
is clear. It is never cleared by the redistributor, so you can't rely on
it here.

Cheers,
Andre.
