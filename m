Yes, this seems like a good idea. I almost suggested it when
I was writing out my review comments, in fact...

But the only reason we're fixing anything up is that we're
working around the bug. If we didn't have that bug and the
QEMU definition of where SPSR_EL1's state lived correctly
pointed at banked_spsr[1], then the only thing you'd need
to do for syncing is copy the KVM SPSRs into banked_spsr[1..5].
