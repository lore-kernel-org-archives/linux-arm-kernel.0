How's that? Bits 52 .. 54 will still be set, so SP will never contain
a valid userland address in any case. Or am I missing something?

Good point. I did consider that, but couldn't convince myself that it
isn't easier to defeat: loads via x29 occur reasonably often, and you
can simply offset your doctored stack frame by a single byte.
