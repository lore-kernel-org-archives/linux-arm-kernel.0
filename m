[Please send properly formatted and written e-mails to this mailing
list instead of just forwarding a conversation withtout futher
explanation.  It would have been more helpful if you had suggested a
patch or at least explained what you concluded from your conversation
with Matt.]

I don't think there's a problem here, because the ESR values are defined
as

#define ESR_ELx_EC_IABT_LOW?    (0x20)
#define ESR_ELx_EC_IABT_CUR?    (0x21)
...
#define ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_LOW?    (0x24)
#define ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_CUR?    (0x25)

and we just or on the differating bit for a data abort:

if (!is_iabt)
	esr |= ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_LOW << ESR_ELx_EC_SHIFT;

So you'll see that ESR_ELx_EC_IABT_LOW and ESR_ELx_EC_IABT_CUR become
ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_LOW and ESR_ELx_EC_DABT_CUR, respectively.

Thanks,
-Christoffer
