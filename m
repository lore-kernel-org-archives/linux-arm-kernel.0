I think we don't need to update the type of mpidr. mpidr fits in
"unsigned long" nicely and kvm_vcpu_get_mpidr_aff() applies
MPIDR_HWID_BITMASK mask anyway.

In my patch I just abused GENMASK_ULL() and the proper fix for warning
produced by gcc should be

+	value = (u64)(mpidr & GENMASK(23, 0)) << 32;
