Yeah, this hack doesn't cut it. Sorry. Tried to implement these changes:

I'm trying to make sure that kernel headers in userspace compile with minimal
dependencies which are gcc and libc.

For me it is clear by now that many Linux API's and ABI's like Xen parts do
not live in the uapi header files and instead there's a separate userspace
library with needed headers and defines which have embedded copies of
the needed API and ABI definitions, like header files.

So how could this file be changed so that it compiles in userspace without
definitions from libxenctrl?

I guess I could copy the needed definitions for domid_t and xen_pfn_t from
xen/interface/xen.h of libxenctrl. That I should have done to begin with
instead of trying to hack something on my own.
