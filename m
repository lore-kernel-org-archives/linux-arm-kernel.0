ah, EL2 accesses themselves trap too, ouch.

wait, it looks like you're missing a store of the host fpsimd state in
the switch_to_guest_fpsimd situation.

It think this would be easier to follow if the aarch32 FP registers were
handled as part of the __save_fpsimd  and __restore_fpsimd routines
instead.


Does this help anything?

Otherwise, I assume you've tested thoroughly between something like
v4.2-rc2 and this patch, so that you're sure we didn't have the 32-bit
processed crash before?

Thanks,
