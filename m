I'm not sure what the stuff about "what would you write?" means, I'm
assuming it means that the ISV bit is clear.

I think the point is more that if there's no S2 mapping, then there
could never be any cache entries as a result of memory accesses using
the GVA in question, so there's nothing to invalidate (like you state in
your commit message).

some nitpicking: if you modify anything here, I think is_cm is more clear than iscm.

But besides the cosmetics:
