Indeed, in this scenario clearing bit 55 immediately before the final 
ret does nothing because the "valid" return beforehand loaded x29 with 
an arbitrary userspace address from a doctored stack frame, so the rest 
of that epilogue beyond that first mov already ran off the fake stack.

Admittedly you might have to retain control of the "real" kernel stack 
and go through much the same dance if the gadget chain ever needs to 
pass through a real return target (to mitigate bit 55 being 
unconditionally set again to make an invalid TTBR1 address). Working 
around the mitigations certainly makes the exploit more difficult, but 
still seemingly far from impossible. And yes, AFAICS an attacker could 
indeed use the same SP-hijacking trick today (in the same absence of 
PAN), it's just that without any mitigations to prevent using the kernel 
stack alone I can't imagine it would be worth the extra complication.

I guess what I'm getting at is that if the protection mechanism is 
"always return with SP outside TTBR1", there seems little point in going 
through the motions if SP in TTBR0 could still be valid and allow an 
attack to succeed anyway; this is basically just me working through a 
justification for saying the proposed scheme needs "depends on ARM64_PAN 
|| ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN", making it that much uglier for v8.0 CPUs...
