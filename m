Subject: [PATCH v4 0/2] Implement a software workaround for Falkor erratum 1041
Message-ID: <1511824680-16397-1-git-send-email-shankerd@codeaurora.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

On Falkor CPU, we?ve discovered a hardware issue which might lead to a
kernel crash or the unexpected behavior. The Falkor core may errantly
access memory locations on speculative instruction fetches. This may
happen whenever MMU translation state, SCTLR_ELn[M] bit is being changed
from enabled to disabled for the currently running exception level. To
prevent the errant hardware behavior, software must execute an ISB
immediately prior to executing the MSR that changes SCTLR_ELn[M] from a
value of 1 to 0.

These v4 patches are based on 4.15-rc1 and tested on QDF2400 platform.

Patch2 from V1 series got dropped to accommodate review comments. Apply
the workaround where it's required.

Posted wrong the patches in v2.
