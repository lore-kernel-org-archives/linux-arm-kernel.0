I think so!

AFAIU, the memory where CPERs will reside should be specified in a GHES entry in
the HEST. Is this not the case with a guest kernel i.e. the guest UEFI creates a
HEST for the guest Kernel?

If so, then the question is how the guest UEFI finds out where QEMU (acting as
EL3 firmware) will populate the CPERs. This could either be a contract between
the two or a guest DXE driver uses the MM_COMMUNICATE call (see [1]) to ask QEMU
where the memory is.

This is the way I expect it to work at the EL3/EL2 boundary. So I am
extrapolating it to the guest/hypervisor boundary. Do shout if I am missing
anything.
