Subject: [PATCH 5/7] ARM: dts: r8a7791: Use R-Car Gen2 Ether fallback compat
 string
In-Reply-To: <20171018072728.14681-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <20171018072728.14681-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Message-ID: <20171018072728.14681-6-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Use newly added R-Car Gen2 Ether fallback compat string
in the DT of the r8a7791 SoC.

This should have no run-time effect as the driver matches against
the per-SoC compat string before considering the fallback compat string.
