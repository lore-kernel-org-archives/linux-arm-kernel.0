In that case, we need to cache the highest active priorities updated
by a VM in a variable
when APnR is restored and later check against num_pri_bits when
ICC_CTLR_EL1 is updated.
If the value cached is greater than num_pri_bits restored then reject
ICC_CTLR_EL1 restore.

This variable should be initialized with value 5 ( min priority)

At VM runtime irrespective of VM's num_pri_bits all the APnR registers that
HW supports are saved and restored.

In sys_reg_desc the access function is of type

        bool (*access)(struct kvm_vcpu *,
                       struct sys_reg_params *,
                       const struct sys_reg_desc *);

Where as the each register access function is of type below to support
access to AArch32(later if not now).

bool access_gic_xxx(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, bool is_write, unsigned long *reg);

I can drop this macro and make function calls for each reg access.
