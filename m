Subject: [PATCH v11 00/21] KVM: ARM64: Add guest PMU support
Message-ID: <1454656456-11640-1-git-send-email-zhaoshenglong@huawei.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Shannon Zhao <shannon.zhao@linaro.org>

This patchset adds guest PMU support for KVM on ARM64. It takes
trap-and-emulate approach. When guest wants to monitor one event, it
will be trapped by KVM and KVM will call perf_event API to create a perf
event and call relevant perf_event APIs to get the count value of event.

Use perf to test this patchset in guest. When using "perf list", it
shows the list of the hardware events and hardware cache events perf
supports. Then use "perf stat -e EVENT" to monitor some event. For
example, use "perf stat -e cycles" to count cpu cycles and
"perf stat -e cache-misses" to count cache misses.

Below are the outputs of "perf stat -r 5 sleep 5" when running in host
and guest.

Have a cycle counter read test like below in guest and host:

static void test(void)
{
	unsigned long count, count1, count2;
	count1 = read_cycles();
	count++;
	count2 = read_cycles();
}

Host:
count1: 3046505444
count2: 3046505575
delta: 131

Guest:
count1: 5932773531
count2: 5932773668
delta: 137

The gap between guest and host is very small. One reason for this I
think is that it doesn't count the cycles in EL2 and host since we add
exclude_hv = 1. So the cycles spent to store/restore registers which
happens at EL2 are not included.

This patchset can be fetched from [1] and the relevant QEMU version for
test can be fetched from [2].

The results of 'perf test' can be found from [3][4].
The results of perf_event_tests test suite can be found from [5][6].

Also, I have tested "perf top" in two VMs and host at the same time. It
works well.

Thanks,
Shannon
