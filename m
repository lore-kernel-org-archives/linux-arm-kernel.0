yeah, that's what I thought first, but then I thought it's typically
easier to understand the logic in the C-code and this is technically a
side-effect from the name of the function "kvm_restore_host_vfp_state"
which should then be "kvm_restore_host_vfp_state_and_clear_dirty_flag"
:)

If you're expecting to trap all accesses by setting CPTR_EL2_TFP and
you're running a 32-bit guest, you must also enable in fpexec32, because
otherwise the trap is not taken to EL2, but to EL1 instead.

Before these patches, we *always* expected to trap VFP accesses after
entering the guest, but since that has now changed, you should only
fiddle with fpexec32 if you are indeed trapping (first entry after
vcpu_load) and if it's a 32-bit VM.

Does that help?

duh, I didn't see the 'b' in strb - I guess I was too tired to review
patches.
