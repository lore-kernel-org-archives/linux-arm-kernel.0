Subject: [PATCH 0/5] KVM/ARM: Fixes for 4.12-rc1
Message-ID: <20170502133041.10980-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>

Here's a handful of random fixes I've queued locally that didn't have
a chance to make it in 4.11.

The first two patches avoid stack-protector messing with the HYP code,
as this ends up being a complete disaster.

The following two patches fix a bug introduced in the new vgic, where
we may queue HW interrupts with the Pending+Active state, which is
illegal.

The final patch fixes a misinterpretation of the spec, where we
compute the number of APxRn register based on the number of priorities
instead of using the number of preemption levels.

I've tagged the first 4 patches for stable, given that we're doing
something potentially harmful. The last patch is more of a theoretical
issue at this stage, so probably need for a backport.
