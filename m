I understand that the stub needs to split the init text/data since
unlike the kernel it'll map those with separate permissions, but it
feels odd to do this specifically for the EFI stub.

Yould it perhaps make more sense to always use separate segments for
init/exit text/data, and also apply the permission split in the kernel?

With that, I don't think we'd need additional stub-specific linker
script changes.

Thanks,
Mark.
