Shouldn't restoring the pending tables happen when restoring some
redeistributor state and not anything related to the ITS?

Why do you need this if you anyway need to restore the CTLR as the last
thing?  Just to make it absolutely clear when it happens, or is there
something which has to happen between the CTLR and the RESTORE?
