Hi Laura,

Neat!

I *think* this should happen in finish_ret_to_user a few lines down, since we
can call C code if we branch to work_pending, dirtying the stack.

THREAD_START_SP got killed off in commit 34be98f4944f9907 as part of the
VMAP_STACK rework, so this can be:

      +---+ <- task_stack_page(p) + THREAD_SIZE
      |   |
      |   |
      +---+ <- task_pt_regs(p)
       ...

AFAICT, we only call this from ret_to_user, where x0 doesn't need to be
preserved.

Is that for ret_fast_syscall? In some cases, ret_fast_syscall can bypass
ret_to_user and calls kernel_exit directly, so we might need a call there.

Can we replace the MOVN;AND with a single instruction to clear the low bits?
e.g.

	mov	x4, sp
	bic	x1, x4, #THREAD_SIZE - 1

... IIUC BIC is an alias for the bitfield instructions, though I can't recall
exactly which one(s).

Is that to ensure that we don't clobber the word at the current sp value?

I believe the KVM hyp code will also need to opt-out of this.

Thanks,
Mark.
