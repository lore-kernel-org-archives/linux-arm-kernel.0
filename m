So first of all, while I appreciate your efforts to explain your
rationale here, I am also asking you to provide a more comprehensive
commit message for the next version of the patch.

I haven't thought much about it, but there are unanswered questions to
me.  For example, does the type and capabilities of the guest in any way
affect whether or not this features should be available?  Are there any
concerns with respect to migration?

And then the point I raised below, which is that this KVM-specific ioctl
is returning a hardware property of the CPU (the one the ioctl happens
to run on - what happens on a heterogeneous system?), but not really
what KVM can and cannot do.  At the very least this should be based on
a more generic in-kernel functionality, which reports the capabilities
of a system to KVM, and KVM could then tell userspace if it has a
certain capability.

Hope this helps,
