I should've clarified in my reply that I wasn't looking to support the
third instance from Mark's examples above - "monitor all vCPUs on a
pCPU". I think it'll be quite expensive to figure out which threads from
a given pool are vCPUs.

For the other instances, we only need to find the vCPU for a given
pid. Userspace will hand us a pid that needs to be checked against vCPUs
to establish that it is a valid vCPU pid (here I was looking to use
kvm_vcpu->pid and kvm->pid introduced in Patch 2).

This will happen when setting up the event and the vCPU can be cached
for later use.
