Please solve this in an arch independent way.  This situation is
basically unusably broken on x86 right now.  Please solve it for real,
by, for example, adding a new ptrace operation that returns something
like this:

enum ptrace_syscall_state {
  NO_SYSCALL,
  SYSCALL_ENTRY,
  SYSCALL_EXIT,
  /* other values may be defined in the future. */
};

struct ptrace_syscall_info {
  enum ptrace_syscall_state state;
  unsigned long arch;
  union {
    struct {
      unsigned long nr;
      unsigned long args[6];
   } entry;
   struct {
      unsigned long ret;
   } exit;
};

where arch is an AUDIT_ARCH_XYZ constant.

On x86, it's currently essentially impossible for tools like strace to
correctly decode syscalls.

Yes it can.
