Hi Christoffer,
   I just managed to boot qemu arm32 up on arm64 (last Fri - thanks for the tip
- there were few other issue to clean up), so let me retest it again. Also I
noticed some refactoring would help both 32 and 64 bit patches.

Yes I could provide a the user space tests as well.

Thanks-
- Mario
