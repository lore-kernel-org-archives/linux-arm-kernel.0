Sorry for the *really* long delay in this response.

We had a chat about this subject with Will Deacon and Marc Zyngier
during connect, and basically we came to think of a number of problems
with the current approach:

1. As you pointed out, there is a need for a shared IRQ handler, and
   there is no immediately nice way to implement this without a more
   sophisticated perf/kvm interface, probably comprising eventfds or
   something similar.

2. Hijacking the counters for the VM without perf knowing about it
   basically makes it impossible to do system-wide event counting, an
   important use case for a virtualization host.

So the approach we will be taking now would be to:

First, implement a strictly trap-and-emulate in software approach.  This
would allow any software relying on access to performance counters to
work, although potentially with slightly unprecise values.  This is the
approach taken by x86 and would be significantly simpler to support on
systems like big.LITTLE as well.

Second, if there are values obtained from within the guest that are so
skewed by the trap-and-emulate approach that we need to give the guest
access to counters, we should try to share the hardware by partitioning
the physical counters, but again, we need to coordinate with the host
perf system for this.  We would only be pursuing this approach if
absolutely necessary.

Apologies for the change in direction on this.

What are your thoughts?  Do you still have time/interest to work
on any of this?

Thanks,
-Christoffer
