My stand here is that we *are* exposing the real thing - we just decided
to use a funny format.  If anything relied on the format being exported
as reading the GICC_PMR directly, then their code would be already
broken, and I don't think we care about supporting an already-broken
non-functional userspace.  The ABI is already what it is - not
beautiful - but functionally just fine.

I don't think it really impacts anything.  For example, KVM to TCG will
still work, it just requires userspace to do the wrangling of shifting
the PMR 3 bits left and right, but it knows all about the versions it's
dealing with etc. so that can be solved in userspace as well.

And also, you're right, nobody is doing anything like this in userspace
in the moment, so let's just clarify our bad ABI and declare success ;)

Yeah, so that's the idea.  My thought is that we either (a) don't use
the intermediate struct vmcr representation for PMR at all, or (b)
clearly define why we need to intermediate data structure and which
format it should be in (the architectural one).

If there's a better case for (a), we can do that too, but I found this
one easily explainable with the comments I suggested.

Cool.  Would you like me to send a proper patch, or do you prefer to
take care of this one on your end?

Thanks,
