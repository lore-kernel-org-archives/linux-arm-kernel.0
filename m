Putting in a patch which might not be the right fix isn't
necessarily a good plan either...

Does has_run_once get cleared if we do a re-VCPU_INIT
of a CPU that's run before? (We need to allow rewriting
of guest state at that point so that "reset VM and
load migration state" behaves correctly.)

I suspect Jan is right and we really need to distinguish
the KVM_PUT_*_STATE levels in ARM QEMU. This probably
implies some kind of whitelist/override mechanism, since
by and large we neither know nor want to know the
semantics for system registers, we leave that up to the
kernel.

Q: if you have a running VM, and you pause it for
an hour, what should the CNTVCT register do? Presumably
it should not advance, but how do we arrange for that
to happen?
