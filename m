Good point, this happened because I was trying to keep the same shape as the
existing notify_nmi() code as far as possible.

I didn't think that would build without an empty declaration for arm64, I
assumed it would generate an implicit-declaration-of warning. But, I've tried
it, and evidently today's toolchain does dead-code elimination before generating
implicit-declaration-of warnings...
I'd prefer to leave this (ugly as it is), to avoid warnings on a different
version of the compiler.


Thanks,

James
