ok, so by "HW interrupts" you mean virtual interrupts with the HW bit in
the LR set, correct?

Huh?  Which second interrupt.  I looked at the spec and it says don't
use the state bits for HW interrupts, so isn't it simply not supported
to set these bits at all and that's it?

Sort of, but what I don't understand now is how the guest ever sees the
interrupt then.  If we always inject the virtual interrupt by setting
the active state on the physical distributor, and we can't inject this
as active+pending, and the guest doesn't see the state in the LR, then
how does this ever raise a virtual interrupt and how does the guest see
an interrupt which is only PENDING so that it can ack it etc. etc.?

Maybe I don't fully understand how the HW bit works after all...
