Hmmm, I see your point, but there are some sequencing issues here.

I consider SVE discard as an optional side effect of task_fpsimd_save(),
not something that is guaranteed to happen -- the decision about whether
to do so may become more intelligent later on.  So, for src, we may
discard SVE (because syscall), but for dst we must NULL .sve_state (and
therefore clear TIF_SVE) simply to avoid aliasing of src->sve_state and
dst->sve_state.

The latter requires operating on the thread_flags of dst.  I'll need to
check whether there's another suitable hook for updating the thread flags
of dst, if we aren't confident that they will always have been
initialised by the time arch_dup_task_struct() is called.


Either way, there would be an intra-thread ordering requirement between
the task_struct and thread_info updates here, _if_ dst were schedulable:
dst:TIF_SVE must be cleared before dst->sve_state is NULLed.

dst is not schedulable until fork is done though, so maybe this doesn't
really matter...

Not quite: TIF_SVE must be cleared so that a context switch or
kernel_neon_begin() after dst is scheduled doesn't try to save state in
the (NULL) dst->sve_state.
