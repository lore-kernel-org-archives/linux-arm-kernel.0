Do you mean to add an EABI specific workaround for a specific syscall
if necessary, or to stop adding OABI syscalls altogether?

For the first one, the way that the asm-generic unistd.h handles this is
to have a range of syscall numbers reserved for architecture specific
additions. I was planning to do the same here and have a number of
reserved numbers after the last architecture specific call before
the start of the newly added generic numbers.

That was it, I had merged in my y2038 syscall series for testing and
accidentally dropped that line while rebasing the newly added
syscalls.

For the purpose of generating the tables, I don't see much
difference: we either use the fourth column only in native
mode, or we use the fifth column to override values from
the fourth one when emulating the ABI on the "other" kernel.

That's similar to x86, 32-bit syscalls use the traditional numbers
with an optionally different entry point for compat mode, while
64-bit syscalls use a somewhat reduced table that now has support
for both native 64-bit and "x32" mode. x86-64 and x32 share a
syscall table but not the unistd.h list, all three generated
from syscall_64.tbl.

ARM64 has a separate list of syscalls for compat mode in 
arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h, this list has the same format
as include/asm-generic/uapi/unistd.h and must be updated manually
to match the arch/arm/ table today.

ARM64 will also likely gain native (A64 instruction set) ILP32
support soon, which will use the same numbers as the 64-bit
mode but point to the compat syscalls. This is similar to
how ARM OABI emulation works.

The only important factor here is that the first three columns are used
to generate unistd.h, which is the same for both native and emulated
mode, while the last two columns are used to generate two sets of
syscall tables using the same numbers. This is a common requirement
for OABI mode (native or emulated), EABI (on 32-bit or 64-bit kernels)
and the generic ABI (native 32-bit or emulated 32-bit). 

The 64-bit unistd.h is differs only in those syscalls that got replaced
with when loff_t support was added:

#define __NR_fcntl __NR3264_fcntl
#define __NR_statfs __NR3264_statfs
#define __NR_fstatfs __NR3264_fstatfs
#define __NR_truncate __NR3264_truncate
#define __NR_ftruncate __NR3264_ftruncate
#define __NR_lseek __NR3264_lseek
#define __NR_sendfile __NR3264_sendfile
#define __NR_newfstatat __NR3264_fstatat
#define __NR_fstat __NR3264_fstat
#define __NR_mmap __NR3264_mmap
#define __NR_fadvise64 __NR3264_fadvise64
#define __NR_stat __NR3264_stat
#define __NR_lstat __NR3264_lstat

64-bit architectures still use __NR_fcntl, while 32-bit architectures
use __NR_fcntl64 etc.

Ah, makes sense. I see that x86 does this in
arch/x86/kernel/asm-offsets_64.c in a way that would also work on
other architectures, but being able to share a single script across
all architectures would also help avoid duplicating that code.
