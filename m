OK, I see. At the moment the kvmtool code seems to rely on having only a
single PCI controller using a static setup. As changing this would
require some rework (for instance to allow dynamic MMIO allocation), I
would like to refrain from adding multiple ITS support prematurely now.
We should do this later in conjunction with multiple PCI controller
support, I believe.

OK, got it.

I will post my version with the static phandle setup, feel free to shoot
it down if this is too much of a simplification or if you have the
feeling that removing the allocation will bite us later.

Cheers,
Andre.
