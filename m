Subject: [PATCH v3 00/27] arm64: KVM: Mediate access to GICv3 sysregs at EL2
Message-ID: <20170609114956.25963-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Some systems have less than perfect GICv3 implementations, leading to
all kind of ugly issues (guest hanging, host dying). In order to allow
some level of diagnostic, and in some cases implement workarounds,
this series enables the trapping of both Group-0, Group-1 and Common
sysregs. Mediating the access at EL2 allows some form of sanity
checking that the HW is sometimes sorely lacking.

Instead of fully emulating a GICv3 CPU interface, we still use the
existing HW (list registers, AP registers, VMCR...), which allows the
code to be independent from the rest of the KVM code, and to cope with
partial trapping.

Of course, trapping has a cost, which is why this must be either
enabled on the command line, or selected by another cpu capability
(see Cavium erratum 30115). A quick test on an A57-based platform
shows a 25% hit when repeatedly banging on the trapped registers,
while normal workloads do not seem to suffer noticeably from such
trapping (hackbench variance is in the usual noise, despite being very
IPI happy).

This has been tested on a dual socket Thundex-X and a Freescale
LS-2085a, as well as separately by David Daney and Alex Graf.

I've taken the liberty to rebase David Daney's initial Cavium erratum
30115 workaround on top of this series, and included it here as a
typical use case.

- From v2:
  * Added patches that check for illeggal accesses, just in case...
  * Fixed a number of bugs in handling BPR1, IAR0
  * Tried to clarify the use of the preemption bits
  * Renamed the command-line options to refer to kvm-arm
  * Added documentation for these options
  * Added TBs, ABs, RBs
  * Rebased on 4.12-rc4 + d68356cc51e3 (from kvmarm/master)

- From v1:
  * Fix bug in DIR handling which would have performed a deactivation even
    when EOImode==0
  * Some minor cleanups and clarifications.
  * All the initial fixes have already been merged.
  * Rebased on 4.12-rc3.
