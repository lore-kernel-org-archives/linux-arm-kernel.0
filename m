__get_user_pages_fast is a strict fast path, it will grab as many page
references as it can and if something gets in its way it backs off. As
it can't take locks, it can't inspect the VMA, thus it really isn't in
a position to know if there's an error. It may be possible for the
slow path to take a write fault for a read only pte, for instance.
(we could in theory return an error on pte_special and save a fallback
to the slowpath but I don't believe it's worth doing as special ptes
should be encountered very rarely by the fast_gup).

I think it's safe to assume that __get_use_pages_fast has non-negative
return values; also it is logically contained in the same area as
get_user_pages_fast, so if this does change we can apply changes below
it too.

get_user_pages_fast attempts the fast path but is allowed to fallback
to the slowpath, so is in a position to return an error code thus can
return negative values.

I read it as "did the fast path get at least one page?".

Thank you for giving this a going over.
