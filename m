I'm fine with adding your text as a clarification - but I think 'quietly 
ignoring fatal conditions' very much implies an undefined outcome if that 
unexpected condition does occur: the code might crash, it might corrupt 
memory or it might do some other unexpected thing.

There are many other places that do a BUG_ON() of a NULL pointer or so, or 
of a zero refcount, or a not held lock - and turning the BUG_ON() off 
makes the code unpredictable _anyway_ - even if the compiler does not 
notice an uninitialized variable.

So pretty much any weakening of BUG_ON() _will_ make the kernel more 
unpredictable.

It will often continue blindly into the unknown even if the compiler is 
happy ...

The only difference is that it's "unpredictable" in a way not visible from 
the C code: the code won't necessarily fall through the BUG() when hitting 
that condition - although in practice it probably will.

So I think the same principle applies to it as to any other debugging 
code: it's fine to be able to turn debugging off. It's a performance 
versus kernel robustness/determinism trade-off.

Thanks,
