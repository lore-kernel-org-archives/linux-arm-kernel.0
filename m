   here do you mean map host APEI table to guest for steps 1 and 2 test? so that the APEI path in the
  host and guest is the same.

yes, some of error does not need to deliver to guest OS directly. for example if the error is guest kernel fault error,
hypervisor can directly power off the whole guest OS

for this example, I think it is better hypervisor directly close the whole guest OS, instead of
guest power-off the vCPU.

Thank you to point that. sorry, my answer is not right. in fact, I think the FAR and
CPER are both not accurate for the  asynchronous SError. so guest OS can not try to recover.
but it can still know which application create this SError which is deferred by ESB, then guest OS close the APP.
by the way, for the synchronous SEA, do you think which address should be used? FAR or CPER that record come from ERR<n>ADDR?
I see Qualcomm series patches mainly use FAR not CPER record that come from ERR<n>ADDR for SEA.
so for the SEA case, I do not know which address is more accurate for FAR and CPER record

 thanks for your suggestion.
