The currently intended ABI is that the SVE bits are unspecified after a
syscall, so it is legitimate (though perhaps surprising) for different
things to happen in dst and src.

This complicates things a lot though, just to avoid the next SVE usage
exception in src after the fork.


It should be simpler to do what you suggest and discard the SVE state of
src unconditionally before the copy: then we really are just cloning the
thread apart from the need to set dst->thread.sve_state to NULL.

fpsimd_preserve_current_state() does not necessarily write back to
current->thread.fpsmid_state though: at the moment, it does do this as a
side effect of task_fpsimd_save() because we happen to be in a syscall
(i.e., fork).  

What we really want is unconditional discarding of the state.  This
wasn't needed anywhere else yet, so there's no explicit helper for it.
But it makes sense to add one.

What about refactoring along these lines:


fpsimd.c:
/* Unconditionally discard the SVE state */
void task_sve_discard(struct task_struct *task)
{
	if (!system_supports_sve())
		return;

	local_bh_disable();
	if (test_and_clear_tsk_thread_flag(task, TIF_SVE))
		sve_to_fpsimd(task);
	local_bh_enable();
}

process.c:
int arch_dup_task_struct(sturct task_struct *dst, struct task_struct *src)
{
	if (current->mm) {
		fpsimd_preserve_current_state();
		task_sve_discard(src);
	}

	*dst = *src;

	dst->thread.sve_state = NULL;
}


This also avoids having to touch dst's thread flags, since now we
are just cloning the task except for assigning NULL to
dst->thread.sve_state.

With the above factoring, the constraint "TIF_SVE implies sve_state
valid" is then never false, because TIF_SVE is already cleared before
the NULL assignment.

What do you think?
