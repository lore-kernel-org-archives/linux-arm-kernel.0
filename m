So, the NOACPI allocation hint is a no-go at the moment, based on the
discussion in the following threads:

Therefore the header probe suppression remains necessary.

In this case, it is not hard to do, you just have to reorder the
following two ADD_POINTER additions a bit:

>>> +
>>> +        bios_linker_loader_add_pointer(linker, GHES_ERRORS_FW_CFG_FILE,
>>> +                                sizeof(uint64_t) * i, sizeof(uint64_t),
>>> +                                GHES_ERRORS_FW_CFG_FILE,
>>> +                                MAX_ERROR_SOURCE_COUNT_V6 * sizeof(uint64_t) +
>>> +                                i * MAX_RAW_DATA_LENGTH);

This one should be moved out to a separate loop, after the current loop.

>>> +        bios_linker_loader_add_pointer(linker, ACPI_BUILD_TABLE_FILE,
>>> +                    address_registers_offset
>>> +                    + i * sizeof(AcpiGenericHardwareErrorSource),
>>> +                    sizeof(uint32_t), GHES_ERRORS_FW_CFG_FILE,
>>> +                    i * sizeof(uint64_t));

This one should be kept in the first (i.e., current) loop.

The idea is, when you first point the HEST/GHES_n entries in
ACPI_BUILD_TABLE_FILE to the "address registers" in
GHES_ERRORS_FW_CFG_FILE, all those address registers will still be
zero-filled. This will fail the ACPI table header probe in
OvmfPkg/AcpiPlatformDxe, which is what we want.

After this is done, the address registers in GHES_ERRORS_FW_CFG_FILE
should be pointed to the error status data blocks in the same fw_cfg
blob, in a separate loop. (Those error status data blocks will again be
zero-filled, so no ACPI table headers will be mistakenly recognized in
them.)

Thanks
