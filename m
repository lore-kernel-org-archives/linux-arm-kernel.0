Is "-Wa,arch=armv7-a+virt" (as we appear to do for a couple of files 
already) viable as a possibly cleaner alternative, or is GCC itself now 
policing the contents of inline asms?

Would it be worth wrapping this in a preprocessor check for compilers 
that won't understand the command-line flag? I believe LLVM tends to 
choke on these global asm statements entirely, so minimising exposure 
might be a good thing to do in general.
