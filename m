This depends whether you're talking about the ICC/ICV BPR0/BPR1 registers,
or the fields in the ICH_VMCR*. For the former, if CBPR is set then
BPR1 reads and writes affect BPR0. For the latter, the two fields
are both independent and read-as-written regardless of the value
of CBPR, it's just that the value in the BPR1 field has no effect.
(The reason for this is for VM state migration: if a guest does:
  - write X to BPR0
  - write Y to BPR1
  - set CBPR
  - write Z to BPR0
  - unset CBPR
  - read BPR1
it should get back Y still; so EL2 needs to have a way to see
both the underlying BPR0 and BPR1 values even if CPBR is in effect.)

So the code above is not correct, I think, because it's making
writes to BPR0 affect the BPR1 value. Instead what should happen
is that when we emulate reads and writes to ICC_BPR1 we should pay
attention to CBPR and work with either the VMCR BPR0 or BPR1 field
appropriately.
