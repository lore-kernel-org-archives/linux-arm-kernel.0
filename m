Yeah, the FP architecture has all kind of nasty tricks like this.

A store of FPEXC32_EL2 for the host? No, this register has no
significance whatsoever for a 64bit host. Its sole purpose is to
accommodate a 32bit guest (see D7.2.31). Or are you thinking of
something else?

Maybe. This code needs some rework...

Not really, sorry... :-(

Without the lazy switching, we seem to be rock solid. With lazy
switching, I get these illegal instructions, always on VFP ops. My
current thinking is that it has something to do with CPACR_EL1, and the
fact that the 32bit kernel turns it VFP on/off all the time.
