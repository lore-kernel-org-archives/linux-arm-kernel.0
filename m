This stuff is breaking what the intention is with the
phys_timer_emulate() function.  See the comment above the function,
which says that this is about scheduling the background soft timer, and
not about managing the rest of the state.

At least that function needs updating.

This is clearly racy as you'll lower the interrupt that may have just
fired between these two lines.

Overall, I think this approach is wrong.

Please see the following suggestion for doing this in two patches
instead:

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Fix potential loss of ptimer interrupts

kvm_timer_update_state() is called when changing the phys timer
configuration registers, either via vcpu reset, as a result of a trap
from the guest, or when userspace programs the registers.

phys_timer_emulate() is in turn called by kvm_timer_update_state() to
either cancel an existing software timer, or program a new software
timer, to emulate the behavior of a real phys timer, based on the change
in configuration registers.

Unfortunately, the interaction between these two functions left a small
race; if the conceptual emulated phys timer should actually fire, but
the soft timer hasn't executed its callback yet, we cancel the timer in
phys_timer_emulate without injecting an irq.  This only happens if the
check in kvm_timer_update_state is called before the timer should fire,
which is relatively unlikely, but possible.

The solution is to update the state of the phys timer after calling
phys_timer_emulate, which will pick up the pending timer state and
update the interrupt value.

Note that this leaves the opportunity of raising the interrupt twice,
once in the just-programmed soft timer, and once in
kvm_timer_update_state.  Since this always happens synchronously with
the VCPU execution, there is no harm in this, and the guest ever only
sees a single timer interrupt.

Subject: [PATCH 2/2] KVM: arm/arm64: Fix lost IRQs from emulated physcial
 timer when blocked

When the VCPU is blocked (for example from WFI) we don't inject the
physical timer interrupt if it should fire while the CPU is blocked, but
instead we just wake up the VCPU and expect kvm_timer_vcpu_load to take
care of injecting the interrupt.

Unfortunately, kvm_timer_vcpu_load() doesn't actually do that, it only
has support to schedule a soft timer if the emulated phys timer is
expected to fire in the future.

Follow the same pattern as kvm_timer_update_state() and update the irq
state after potentially scheduling a soft timer.
