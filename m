So I had another look at that, and I'm not sure there is any way to make
it really nicer, other than expanding all of the apxrn accessors to deal
with non constant x and n (which makes the code look really awful).

I'm pretty confident that it is nigh impossible to get x or n out of
bounds so unless someone shouts, I plan on keeping this code mostly
unchanged for the next repost.

Thanks,
