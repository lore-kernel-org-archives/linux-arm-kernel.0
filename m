+* APM X-Gene SOC Queue Manager/Traffic Manager nodes
+
+QMTM nodes are defined to describe on-chip Queue Managers in APM X-Gene SOC.
+APM X-Gene SOC Ethernet, PktDMA, and Security Engine subsystems communicate
+with a central Queue Manager using messages which include information about
+the work to be performed and the location of the associated data buffers.
+There are multiple instances of QMTM. Each QMTM instance has its own node.
+Its corresponding clock nodes are shown below.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible		: Shall be "apm,xgene-qmtm-lite" for QMLite instance
+- reg			: First memory resource shall be the QMTM CSR memory
+			  resource.
+			  Second memory resource shall be the QMTM IO-Fabric
+			  memory resource.
+- slave-name		: Shall be "CPU_QMTM3" which is receiver for ingress
+			  work messages for the QMTM. Here receiver is CPU.
+- interrupts		: First interrupt resource shall be the QMTM Error
+			  interrupt.
+			  Remaining interrupt resources shall be the Ingress
+			  work message interrupt mapping for receiver,
+			  receiving work messages for the QMTM.
+- clocks		: Reference to the clock entry.
+
+Optional properties:
+- status		: Shall be "ok" if enabled or "disabled" if disabled.
+			  Default is "ok".
+
+Example:
+		qmlclk: qmlclk {
+			compatible = "apm,xgene-device-clock";
+			#clock-cells = <1>;
+			clock-names = "qmlclk";
+			status = "ok";
+			csr-offset = <0x0>;
+			csr-mask = <0x3>;
+			enable-offset = <0x8>;
+			enable-mask = <0x3>;
+		};
+
+		qmlite: qmtm at 17030000 {
+			compatible = "apm,xgene-qmtm-lite";
+			reg = <0x0 0x17030000 0x0 0x10000>,
+			      <0x0 0x10000000 0x0 0x400000>;
+			slave-name = "CPU_QMTM3";
+			interrupts = <0x0 0x40 0x4>,
+				     <0x0 0x3c 0x4>;
+			status = "ok";
+			#clock-cells = <1>;
+			clocks = <&qmlclk 0>;
+		};
