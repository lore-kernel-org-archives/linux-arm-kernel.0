It also later says that the ICV_BPR1_EL1 IMPDEF reset value is always
the ICV_BPR0_EL1 reset value plus one.

I think the plus-one is the only interesting difference and the
rest is just accidental difference of wording.

There is a difference between ICV_BPR* and ICC_BPR*, which is that
the latter reset to an UNKNOWN value, not necessarily the minimum.
