I followed up with the ARM architects on potential improvements to this
sequence. In summary, changing TCR_EL1.A1 is not guaranteed to have an
effect unless it is followed by TLBI. IOW, we can't use this bit for a
quick switch to the reserved ASID.

Setting TCR_EL1.EPD0 to 1 would work as long as it is followed by an
ASID change to a reserved one with no entries in the TLB. However, the
code sequence above (and the corresponding asm ones) would become even
more complex, so I don't think we gain anything.

Untested, using EPD0 (the assembly version would look sligtly better
than the C version but still a few instructions more than what we
currently have):

static inline void uaccess_ttbr0_disable(void)
{
	unsigned long ttbr;
	unsigned long tcr;

	/* disable TTBR0 page table walks */
	tcr = read_sysreg(tcr_el1);
	tcr |= TCR_ELD0
	write_sysreg(tcr, tcr_el1);
	isb();

	/* mask out the ASID bits (zero is a reserved ASID) */
	ttbr = read_sysreg(ttbr0_el1);
	ttbr &= ~ASID_MASK;
	write_sysreg(ttbr, ttbr0_el1);
	isb();
}

static inline void uaccess_ttbr0_enable(void)
{
	unsigned long flags;

	local_irq_save(flags);

	ttbr = read_sysreg(ttbr0_el1);
	ttbr |= current_thread_info()->asid;
	write_sysreg(ttbr, ttbr0_el1);
	isb();

	/* enable TTBR0 page table walks */
	tcr = read_sysreg(tcr_el1);
	tcr |= TCR_ELD0
	write_sysreg(tcr, tcr_el1);
	isb();

	local_irq_restore(flags);
}

The IRQ disabling for the above sequence is still required since we need
to guarantee the atomicity of the ASID read with the TTBR0_EL1 write.

We may be able to avoid current_thread_info()->asid *if* we find some
other per-CPU place to store the ASID (unused TTBR1_EL1 bits was
suggested, though not sure about the architecture requirements on those
bits being zero when TCR_EL1.A1 is 0). But even with these in place, the
requirement to have to ISBs and the additional TCR_EL1 read/write
doesn't give us anything better.

In conclusion, I propose that we stick to the current TTBR0_EL1 switch
as per these patches.
