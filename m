Subject: [PATCH 03/14] ARM: LPAE: use phys_addr_t in free_memmap()

From: Vitaly Andrianov <vitalya@ti.com>

The free_memmap() was mistakenly using unsigned long type to represent
physical addresses.  This breaks on PAE systems where memory could be placed
above the 32-bit addressible limit.

This patch fixes this function to properly use phys_addr_t instead.
