We already can't guarantee this - if the task invoking a syscall gets
preempted before syscall_trace_enter(), TIF_SVE will be cleared. Are you
reinstating TIF_SVE if the syscall was cancelled?

So my comment was more about consistency on presenting the SVE state to
the debugger handling PTRACE_SYSCALL.

With the sve_sync_to_fpsimd() called before __fpr_set(), it was ok. Once
you removed that you indeed need the change to __fpr_set().

Ah, I forgot about this.

Yes, please.

I'm ok with this approach but I'm not sure we can guarantee it with
preemption enabled.

If such state isn't guaranteed, then the de-facto ABI is that the
debugger cannot simulate any SVE instruction via NO_SYSCALL since the
SVE state may be discarded. So it can only rely on what's guaranteed and
changing the behaviour later won't actually help.
