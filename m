BTW, not all get_user() under KERNEL_DS are plain loads.  There is an
exception - probe_kernel_read().

Folks, reducing the amount of places where we play with set_fs() is certainly
a good thing.  Getting rid of them completely is something entirely different;
I have tried to plot out patch series in this direction many times during the
last 5 years or so, but it's not going to be easy.  Tomorrow I can start
posting my notes in that direction (and there are tons of those, unfortunately
mixed with git grep results, highly unprintable personal comments, etc.);
just let me grab some sleep first...

BTW, slow userland access is not just due to extra checks; access_ok(),
in particular, is pretty much noise.  The real PITA comes from the things
like STAC/CLAC on recent x86.  Or hardware overhead of cross-address-space
block copy insn (e.g. on s390, where it's optimized for multi-cacheline
blocks).  Or things like uml, where it's a matter of walking the page
tables for each sodding __get_user().  It's not always just a matter of
address space limit...
