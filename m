Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here's the first round of fixes for KVM/ARM for v4.15.  This is a fairly large
set of fixes, partially because we spotted a handful of issues from running the
SMATCH static analysis on the code (thanks to AKASHI Takahiro).

In more details, this pull request fixes:
 - A number of issues in the vgic discovered using SMATCH
 - A bit one-off calculation in out stage base address mask (32-bit and
   64-bit)
 - Fixes to single-step debugging instructions that trap for other
   reasons such as MMMIO aborts
 - Printing unavailable hyp mode as error
 - Potential spinlock deadlock in the vgic
 - Avoid calling vgic vcpu free more than once
 - Broken bit calculation for big endian systems
