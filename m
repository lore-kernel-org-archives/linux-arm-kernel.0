Yeah, I've seen that. I even wrote some patches to try and deal with
it once, because RHEL currently has gcc 4.8, and static keys are now
used in kernel hot paths for kpti, and I knew this series was coming.
My patches didn't seem like something usptream would care about, so
I never posted them. Indeed, I see here[*] that at least x86 is saying
that at some point (soon?) asm-goto will be a hard requirement.

I just checked Christoffer's branch. The only hyp_alternate_select,
that couldn't be changed to a has_vhe is __check_arm_834220, but
that one can just be changed to
cpus_have_const_cap(ARM64_WORKAROUND_834220), since it's just acting
as a boolean anyway.

Thanks,
