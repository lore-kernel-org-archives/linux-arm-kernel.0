Is there really a misunderstanding here?  I think the change is that the
user was previously involved and updating the flag reinforced that.  Now
the user is not involved and the flag changing is just unexpected noise.
"automasked" is intentionally not "level" because being level triggered
may not be the only reason we'd need to mask an interrupt upon receiving
it.  We could actually have automasked edge triggered interrupts if we
wanted.  We don't do that, so we can equate automasked to level
currently, but technically automasked simply indicates that an unmask is
required to get the next interrupt.  In this case the VM is able to
effectively do the unmask itself.  Thanks,

Alex
