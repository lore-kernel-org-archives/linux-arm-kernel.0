How was this number chosen?

Kernel stack overflow is not going to get routinely tested -- after all
it should only get exercised when things go horribly wrong.

So, if the panic code (or compiler-generated stack frames) become
bloated enough, we will silently overrun this limit.

Maybe it doesn't matter if we trash a load of unrelated percpu data when
we panic.

Unless I'm missing something, this leaves tpidrr0_el0 trashed (and
containing kernel data that userspace can subsequently read).

This could be solved by moving the tpidrro_el0 load out of context
switch and into ret_to_user.
