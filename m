Subject: [PATCH 24/30] ARM: decompressor: explicitly map decompressor binary
 cacheable
In-Reply-To: <20170814125411.22604-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
References: <20170814125411.22604-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <20170814125411.22604-25-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

When randomizing the kernel load address, there may be a large
distance in memory between the decompressor binary and its payload
and the destination area in memory. Ensure that the decompressor
itself is mapped cacheable in this case, by tweaking the existing
routine that takes care of this for XIP decompressors.
