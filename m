That has absolutely nothing to do with FUD. I'm merily not accepting
argumentations which say: PaX can do it "just"....

That has exactly zero technical merit and it's not asked too much to
provide precise technical arguments why one implementation is better than
some other.

Works for me has never be a good engineering principle.

It's a difference whether you maintain a special purpose patch set out of
tree for a subset of architectures - I certainly know what I'm talking
about - or keeping stuff sane in the upstream kernel.

It's bound to happen due to some subtle mistake and up to the point where
you catch it (in the scheduler or entry/exit path) the world is
writeable. And that will be some almost never executed error path which can
be triggered by a carefully crafted attack. A very restricted writeable
region is definitely preferred over full world writeable then, right?

It would be apprectiated if you could keep your feud out of this. It's
enough to tell me that 'rare write' is a misleading term and why.

If it'd be guaranteed to be a few instructions, then I wouldn't be that
worried. The availability of make_world_writeable() as an unrestricted
usable function makes me nervous as hell. We've had long standing issues
where kmap_atomic() got leaked through a hard to spot almost never executed
error handling path. And the same is bound to happen with this, just with a
way worse outcome.

Which attacker controlled pointer?
