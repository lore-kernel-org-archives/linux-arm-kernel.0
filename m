Subject: [PATCH v3 4/4] ARM: dts: mmc slot node gone on rk3288 => no more
 address / size cells

We've removed the slot node from all rk3288 device trees, so we no
longer need address-cells or size-cells.

If Jaehoon's (mmc: dw_mmc: Slot quirk "disable-wp" is deprecated)
patch lands before my (ARM: dts: Add emmc and sdmmc to the rk3288
device tree) then this could be squashed into the later patch.
