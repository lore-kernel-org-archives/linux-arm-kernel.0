Ah, so we can't configure the trap and leave it active, since it'll
affect the host.

We could have a per-cpu flag, and a hook into vcpu_run, but that's also
gnarly.

I'll have a think.

Even if we can't migrate the VM between processes (i.e. it's immutable),
it's still not unique within a process, so I'm fairly sure we need
another mechanism (even if we get away with the common case today).

Thanks,
