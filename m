Oh, I see. Using the minimum number of all the hardware bpts/wpts.

Yeah, I think about how to do it. It could use the same way you do, i.e.
using cpu features to allow userspace to set the number of PMU counters
and store it at vcpu->arch.pmcs. Then when resetting vcpus, sync the
vcpu->arch.pmcs to the emulated register bits PMCR_EL0.N in the
reset_pmcr and if the vcpu->arch.pmcs == 0, use the host value.

What do you think about this?

You can have a look at the guest PMU patchset from [1]
"[PATCH v2 04/22] KVM: ARM64: Add reset and access handlers for PMCR_EL0
register"
