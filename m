I'm not saying your idea is unacceptable - I actually think there is
value in it.  At this time the scheduler will automatically write the
PID to the contextID register when a task is running, a reality this
feature is exploiting.

There is no limitation as to what can be written to the coresight
contextID register - tracing will start for as long as the values and
mask are configured properly.  I do not know the limitation imposed on
the core's contextID register (if any). We'd also have to make sure
that all the code, everywhere, relying on that information has been
modified to take into account the new semantic.
