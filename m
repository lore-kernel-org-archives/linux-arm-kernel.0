My rationale was to avoid copying between the in-memory FPSIMD and SVE
state.

Yes, that's even better.

I missed the px, ffr aspect. Can you not have a clear_sve_state() (or a
better name) function to zero the predicate regs, ffr and the top bits
of the vectors?

Yes, just wondering if this can be implemented with less memory accesses
since the SVE state is irrelevant at this stage.

It looked like some low-hanging optimisation to slightly accelerate the
allocation of the SVE state on access, though I'm also worried I don't
fully understand all the corner cases (like what happens if we allow
interrupts during this function and get preempted).

Anyway, I'm fine to leave this as it is for now and try to optimise it
later with additional patches on top.
