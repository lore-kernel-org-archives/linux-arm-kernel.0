Ah, I was wondering if it was going to turn out to be this,
but I hadn't figured out why it was going to cause us to do
a write-back of state rather than just a read.

arm_cpu_is_big_endian() doesn't actually want to write
back any state -- all it's interested in is reading.
So we really ought not to need to write anything back there.
kvm-all.c's sync functions don't seem to provide a "sync
kernel state to userspace but I promise I'm not going to
dirty it" function though. I guess we could add one.

(Overall it's kind of fragile even if we can avoid this
specific case where we're writing back the counter state,
though -- we should probably think about the sync level
stuff as well.)
