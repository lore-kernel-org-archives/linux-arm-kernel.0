Hi Marc,

   Different tasks have different fs, such as USER_DS or KERNEL_DS. In the context switch, it will restore the
task's fs. Thus, that depends on task itself, as shown below code. UAO is different with PAN, PAN will be always enabled if
hardware CPU supports PAN feature, but UAO is dynamical change.

/*
 * Thread switching.
 */
__notrace_funcgraph struct task_struct *__switch_to(struct task_struct *prev,
				struct task_struct *next)
{
	struct task_struct *last;

	fpsimd_thread_switch(next);
	tls_thread_switch(next);
	hw_breakpoint_thread_switch(next);
	contextidr_thread_switch(next);
	entry_task_switch(next);
	uao_thread_switch(next);
 	..........
}

/* Restore the UAO state depending on next's addr_limit */
void uao_thread_switch(struct task_struct *next)
{
	if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ARM64_UAO)) {
		if (task_thread_info(next)->addr_limit == KERNEL_DS)
			asm(ALTERNATIVE("nop", SET_PSTATE_UAO(1), ARM64_HAS_UAO));
		else
			asm(ALTERNATIVE("nop", SET_PSTATE_UAO(0), ARM64_HAS_UAO));
	}
}
