I meant in the patchset here, not in grsecurity.  grsecurity (on very,
very brief inspection) seems to read cr0 and fix it up in
pax_enter_kernel.

If I'm reading this right, you're saying that a non-flushing CR3 write
is about the same cost as a CR0.WP write.  If so, then why should CR0
be preferred over the (arch-neutral) CR3 approach?  And why would
switching address spaces obviously be much slower?  There'll be a very
small number of TLB fills needed for the actual protected access.
