Subject: [PATCH V2 0/3] mm: Add generic copy from early unmapped RAM
Message-ID: <1438897299-2266-1-git-send-email-msalter@redhat.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

When booting an arm64 kernel w/initrd using UEFI/grub, use of mem= will likely
cut off part or all of the initrd. This leaves it outside the kernel linear
map which leads to failure when unpacking. The x86 code has a similar need to
relocate an initrd outside of mapped memory in some cases.

The current x86 code uses early_memremap() to copy the original initrd from
unmapped to mapped RAM. This patchset creates a generic copy_from_early_mem()
utility based on that x86 code and has arm64 and x86 share it in their
respective initrd relocation code.

Changes from V1:

  * Change cover letter subject to highlight the added generic code

  * Add patch for x86 to use common copy_from_early_mem()
