Sorry, I didn't follow context here. What are these comments referring
to? The dec_and_test implementation?

We can't protect against over-subtraction, since a legitimate
dec-to-zero can't be distinguished from an early dec-to-zero (the
resource will always get freed and potentially abused via
use-after-free). If you mean the case of racing many increments, it
would require INT_MIN / 2 threads perfectly performing an increment
simultaneously with another thread performing a dec_and_test(), which
is unrealistic in the face of saturation happening within a couple
instructions on all of those INT_MIN / 2 threads. So, while
theoretically possible, it is not a real-world condition. As I see it,
this is the trade off of these implementations vs REFCOUNT_FULL, which
has perfect saturation but high performance cost.
