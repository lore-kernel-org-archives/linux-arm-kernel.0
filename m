Subject: [PATCH 9/9] arm64: locking: replace read/write locks with generic
 qrwlock code
In-Reply-To: <1436289865-2331-1-git-send-email-will.deacon@arm.com>
References: <1436289865-2331-1-git-send-email-will.deacon@arm.com>
Message-ID: <1436289865-2331-10-git-send-email-will.deacon@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The queued rwlock implementation in asm-generic is actually pretty
decent, so remove our homebrew (unfair) rwlock implementation in
favour of the generic code.
