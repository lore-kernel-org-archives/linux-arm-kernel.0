Good question.

I was considering this as a debug option, making it possible to catch unsafe
__{get,put}_user() uses via fuzzing or at build time.

As a hardening option, it would make more sense to always have the check in
__{get,put}_user().

Mhmm. I'll take a look at this for v2, afer I've figured out precisely what
I've broken with this RFC.

I'd still like the option to scream on unsafe __{get,put}_user() calls, but it
should be possible to handle both cases with minimal IS_ENABLED() usage.

Thanks,
Mark.
