You're right, this comment is slightly idiotic. What I meant to convey
is that we don't need to provide PC-relative addresses on 32bit. I've
replaced it with:

/*
 * Contrary to arm64, there is no need to generate a PC-relative address
 */

I think you're right. I tend to use "volatile" to prevent the compiler
from optimizing it away, but the fact that we rely on the output of the
sequence makes it impossible.

I tried that as well at some point, but couldn't see how to use it. The
compiler was never happy with my use of the constraints, so I gave up
and did it my way...
