Just a nitpick: ILP32 is in fact just the memory model, but calling from ILP32
code into the Linux kernel requires modifications to the syscall-ABI due to
datastructure layout changing (every time a pointer or a ?long? is present in
a structure). As such structures are passed between the userspace and the
kernel (and also due to the fact that time_t is an ?unsigned long? in the C
language standard), modifications to the syscall ABI in Linux are needed to
support ILP32 processes calling into the kernel.

Things get a bit more involved, as the final consensus was to pass 64bit
quantities in the lower half of 2 64bit registers instead of as a single register:
this makes the way (on AArch64) that an ILP32 process calls into the kernel
more dissimilar from a LP64 process calling the same syscall.

What this rambling boils down to is: ?ILP32" is the memory model, whereas
this series deals with the ?Linux/AArch64 syscall ABI for ILP32 processes?.

Thanks,
Phil.
