Will do, thanks.

How about "#define ESR_Elx_DFSC_UNCATEGORIZED	(0)" ?

Good, thanks for your suggestion. I'll use this macro in next versin.

OK, I'll do it refer to head.S.

Yes, indeed. I'll change it in next version.

Yes, you're right. I'll fix it.

It's different between el0_sync and el0_irq. If sei come from el0_sync,
the context is the same process, so we could just return to user space
after do_sei, instead of continue the syscall. The process may be killed
very likely, it's not necessary to continue the system call.

However, if sei come from el0_irq, in the irq context which is not related
the current process, we should continue the irq handler after do_sei.

So I think we should handle these two situation differently. If I'm wrong,
please correct me, Thanks.

I agree, I'll do it in next version, thanks.

Generally, a SEI is generated when PE consumes an uncorrectable error.
So, may be we could send a SIGBUS instead.

I'm not sure too. Any other suggestion?
