That's an interesting question.  In many cases access_ok() might become
redundant, but for syscalls that you don't want to have side-effects
on user memory on failure it's still relevant.

In the signal case we'd still an encompassing access_ok() to prevent
stack guard overruns, because the signal frame can be large and isn't
written or read contiguously or in a well-defined order.
