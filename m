On this point, it looks like the libgcc unwinder

https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=blob;f=libgcc/config/aarch64/linux-unwind.h;h=d5d6980442fd47b1f1e499e99cb25b5fffbdbeb3;hb=HEAD

doesn't rely on the frame record location.  It clones the (internal)
struct rt_sigframe definition from v3.7, which doesn't include any frame
record, and mines fp and lr out of the signal frame AFAICT.

It appears that gdb and libunwind likely take the same approach, but
I've not looked closely yet.

The frame record in rt_sigframe was added in by Will in 304ef4e83672
("arm64: signal: push the unwinding prologue on the signal stack"),
which changes from pushing the frame record onto the interrupted stack
(which may be inaccessible for a SEGV), to pushing onto the signal
stack.


Even with the frame record split from rt_sigframe, I've not seen any
failed backtrace in gdb.  Throwing an exception from a SEGV handler in
C++ (with -fnon-call-exceptions) also appears to work reliably with
that change, even when the signal frame grows.

In any case, there is no ABI break unless there is extra_context, so
it shouldn't impact current userspace.
