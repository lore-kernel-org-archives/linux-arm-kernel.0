Huge thanks for all the hard work in putting this together, I'm sure it
hasn't been easy.

I have gone through this series and I think we're overall in pretty good
shape.  I haven't reviewed the code in detail, checked every bitfield
etc., but focused on the overall design choices, locking correctness
etc.

A number of patches don't have have commit message and some commit
messages could be clarified, but it is what it is.

I've given this a quick test on Mustang and on TC2, and it builds and
appears to run decently stable.  Obviously we should give this some more
rigorous testing, but I will wait until v2 with that.

I'll probably send the timer/vgic interface changes bits as patches for
you to base the next series on, assuming you and the others agreed with
my comments and suggestions on that part here.

Thanks,
-Christoffer
