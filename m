Coming back to this after spending too long doing something else...

Good idea or not, I don't believe you have a choice. You can be sure you
have pending VLPIs, but you cannot be sure you have none, as you can
easily race against the doorbell interrupt when entering the guest.

That's why we only use pending_last as a hint to tell the hypervisor
that the guest has a pending interrupt. You cannot use it as a hint to
the redistributor that it has no VLPIs.

Thanks,
