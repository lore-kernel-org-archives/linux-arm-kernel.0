I've rearranged this as:

-8<-

/* Definitions for user_sve_header.flags: */
#define SVE_PT_REGS_MASK		(1 << 0)

#define SVE_PT_REGS_FPSIMD		0
#define SVE_PT_REGS_SVE			SVE_PT_REGS_MASK

/*
 * Common SVE_PT_* flags:
 * These must be kept in sync with prctl interface in <linux/ptrace.h>
 */
#define SVE_PT_VL_INHERIT		(PR_SVE_VL_INHERIT >> 16)
#define SVE_PT_VL_ONEXEC		(PR_SVE_SET_VL_ONEXEC >> 16)

->8-

This avoids the suggestion that SVE_PT_REGS_{MASK,FPSIMD,SVE} are
supposed to have prctl counterparts.

I don't really want to write more, in case it is misinterpreted as
specification of behaviour.

This comment is really only meant as a reminder to maintainers that
they should go look at prctl.h too, before blindly making changes
here.


Any good?  If you have a different suggestion, I'm all ears...
