Nitpick: usually we just add static inline functions here rather than
__maybe_unused.

I think we need a WARN_ON if TIF_SVE is still set here (and the callers
making sure it is cleared). I haven't checked the code paths via
fpsimd_release_thread() but wondering what happens if we get an
interrupt between freeing the state and making the pointer NULL, with
some context switching in a preemptible kernel.

Alternatively, always clear TIF_SVE here before freeing (also wondering
whether we should make sve_state NULL before the actual freeing but I
think TIF_SVE clearing should suffice).

This looks fine, thanks for adding the description.
