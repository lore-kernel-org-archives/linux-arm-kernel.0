Subject: [PATCH v9 00/16] KVM: arm64: Optimise FPSIMD context switching
Message-ID: <1526912237-25308-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Note: Most of these patches are Arm-specific.  People not Cc'd on the
whole series can find it in the linux-arm-kernel archive [2].

This series aims to improve the way FPSIMD context is handled by KVM.
Only minor changes have been made since the previous v8 [1], though
this posting does apply a couple of fixes.

This is a minor update to fix a couple of build breaks introduced late
in the evolution of the series. [3] [4]

There is also an unexplained NULL-dereference bug observed by Marc on
ESPRESSOBin [5] that I need to look into.  We've not been able to
reproduce this so far.

In the meantime, this post will give people an opportunity to look over
the current changes.


The changes are summarised in the individual patches.

Reviewers please note:

 * **Only patches 8 and 12** have changed since v8.

 * I have stripped tags from patch 12 due to the introduction of a new
   source file, which may not be the best approach.

   If Christoffer, Marc and Catalin could take another look that
   would be much appreciated.

Cheers
---Dave
