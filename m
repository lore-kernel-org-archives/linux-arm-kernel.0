It looks like SMP ARM issues dsb for rmb, which seems a bit expensive.
http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0204g/CIHJFGFE.html

If I skip the rmb in the secure_computing call before checking mode,
it sounds like I run the risk of racing an out-of-order TIF_SECCOMP vs
mode and filter. This seems unlikely to me, given an addition of the
smp_mb__before_atomic() during the seccomp_assign_mode()? I guess I
don't have a sense of how aggressively ARM might do data caching in
this area. Could the other thread actually see TIF_SECCOMP get set but
still have an out of date copy of seccomp.mode?

I really want to avoid adding anything to the secure_computing()
execution path. :(
