No. KVM_ARM_TARGET_* are part of the uapi, and existing userspace knows
about them. You can't just drop them.

What you *could* do would be to map the existing targets to the generic
one in a way that leaves userspace blissfully unaware of the underlying
change (for example, KVM_ARM_PREFERRED_TARGET should still return
KVM_ARM_TARGET_XGENE_POTENZA on an XGene platform, and
KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT should still be accept it).

What would be the gain of such a mapping? Added complexity, hardly
anything else. We're much better off considering the generic target as
a new one, both inside the kernel and in the view we export to
userspace.

Thanks,
