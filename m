If we're on a GICv3 host and emulating a GICv3 guest, then we never
changed the SRE mode (i.e. it is still set to 1). The only case we
change it is when we when have a GICv2 guest (i.e. when vgic_sre is zero).

So there is no need to restore the host configuration unless we actually
changed it...

... here.

Does it make sense? I could also split this as part of another patch if
you think that's clearer.
