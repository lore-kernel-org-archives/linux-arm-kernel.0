Well for s390 there is no addr_limit as we use two separate address space
for kernel vs. user. The equivalent to the addr_limit corruption on a
fast-path syscall would be changing CR7 outside of set_fs. This boils
down to the question what we are protection against? Bad code with 
unbalanced set_fs or evil code that changes addr_limit/CR7 outside of
set_fs
