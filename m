Do you mean always printing both compat and native hwcaps in
/proc/cpuinfo? We discussed this in the past and it's not something we
can easily fix at this stage without breaking the ABI. If we noticed
this before, we could have used distinct feature strings for AArch32 and
AArch64 (e.g. crypto stuff like aes32 and aes64 but we only have aes for
both).

As I said above, some of them have the same name (which may be a good
thing at a first look) but we don't have an architecture guarantee that
the feature is present in both AArch32 and AArch64 modes (e.g. AES may
only be available in AArch64).
