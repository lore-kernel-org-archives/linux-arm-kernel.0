(unrelated aside: it looks like max_addr is never used or even assigned to;
care to delete it in a prep patch?)

With the EFI runtime map tables it's unfortunately valid (and very likely with
64K pages) that there will be RWX mappings, at least with contemporary versions
of the UEFI spec. Luckily, those are only installed rarely and transiently.

Given that (and other potential ptdump users), I don't think we should have a
dynamic list of ptdump_infos for W^X checks, and should instead have
ptdump_check_wx() explicitly check the tables we care about. More comments
below on that.

I think we only care about the swapper and hyp tables, as nothing else is
permanent. Does that sound sane?

Currently note_page() is painful to read due to the indentation and logic.
Rather than adding to that, could we factor this into a helper? e.g.

note_prot_wx(struct pg_state *st, unsigned long addr)
{
	if (!st->check_wx)
		return;
	if ((st->current_prot & PTE_RDONLY) == PTE_RDONLY)
		return;
	if ((st->current_prot & PTE_PXN) == PTE_PXN)
		return;

	WARN_ONCE(1, "arm64/mm: Found insecure W+X mapping at address %p/%pS\n",
		  (void *)st->start_address, (void *)st->start_address);

	st->wx_pages += (addr - st->start_address) / PAGE_SIZE;
}

As above, I don't think we should use a list of arbitrary ptdump_infos.

Given we won't log addresses in the walking code, I think that we can make up a
trivial marker array, and then just use init_mm direct, e.g. (never even
compile-tested):

void ptdump_check_wx(void)
{
	struct pg_state st = {
		.seq = NULL,
		.marker = (struct addr_markers[]) {
			{ -1, NULL},
		},
		.check_wx = true,
	};

	__walk_pgd(&st, init_mm, 0);
	note_page(&st, 0, 0, 0);
	if (st.wx_pages)
		pr_info("Checked W+X mappings (%p): FAILED, %lu W+X pages found\n",
			info->mm,
			st.wx_pages);
	else
		pr_info("Checked W+X mappings (%p): passed, no W+X pages found\n", info->mm);
}

Otherwise, this looks good to me. Thanks for putting this together!

Mark.
