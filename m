I've did it to really separate dmabounce code and let it be completely 
independent of particular internal functions of the main generic dma-mapping
code.

dmabounce is just one of possible dma-mapping implementation and it is really
convenient to have it closed into common interface (dma_map_ops) rather than
having it spread around and hardcoded behind some #ifdefs in generic ARM
dma-mapping.

There will be also other dma-mapping implementations in the future - I 
thinking mainly of some iommu capable versions. 

In terms of speed I really doubt that these changes have any impact on the
system performance, but they significantly improves the code readability 
(see next patch with cleanup of dma-mapping.c).
