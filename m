So you?re saying there are 2 options:

  1) easy to get right, slightly slower, same ABI to user space as 2
  2) harder to get right, minor performance benefit

That?s an obvious pick, no? Mark it non-RFC and stay with the clearing in assembler entry. If anyone cares about those last few percent, they can still push the harder path upstream later if they want to, but at least we?ll have the ABI stable, so that you can start using and developing for ilp32 on aarch64.
