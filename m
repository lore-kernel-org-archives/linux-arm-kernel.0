Yes, it can be the same. Although, as you said above, "shadow" conventionally
refers to the latter. When it's pointing to EL1 state, it's not really
shadow state anymore.

Oh nothing specifically, I just felt like "shadow" in the function name
could be confusing. Borrowing from kvm_arm_init_cpu_context(), 
how about kvm_arm_setup/restore_cpu_context()  ?

BTW, on a separate note, we might as well get away with the typedef and
call struct kvm_cpu_context directly.
