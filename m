We can have a scenario where I-cache invalidation would not help on ARM.
Some apps may temporarily change protection from RX to RW to write some
data (not instructions) to a page containing code. If Nitin's scenario
happens when the page is RW, the VM_EXEC wouldn't be set, hence no
I-cache invalidation.

The app would later do mprotect(RX) but on some ARM processors
flush_cache_range() is a no-op and therefore no cache flushing. What
other architectures with Harvard caches do for mprotect(RX)? Is this
assumed to invalidate the I-cache?

(we have another I-D cache coherency problem on ARM with COW text pages
following a RX -> RW -> write data -> RX scenario and there are a few
solutions for this, though none of them optimal with the current cache
flushing API, especially with the read-implies-exec ELF personality)
