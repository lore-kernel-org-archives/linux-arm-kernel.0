I had something similar in the earlier versions, where we supported
the "IPA" size for both arm and arm64. But since we restricted this
feature to arm64, I changed the name to make it more generic to
let the archs parse the "vm_type" parameter which could potentially have
more bits defined, not just the IPA size. Hence the change. On arm64, we
only use it for stage2 configuration and on arm32 we make sure the type
is empty.

As such I am fine with suggestion.
