Subject: [PATCH v2 0/8] Rework architected timer and forwarded IRQs handling
Message-ID: <1441395650-19663-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

The architected timer integration with the VGIC had some shortcomings in
that certain guest operations weren't fully supported.

This series tries to address these problems in providing level-triggered
semantics for the arch timer and VGIC integration and seeks to clarify
the behavior when setting/clearing the active state on the physical
distributor.

It also fixes a few other bugs in the VGIC code and finally adds support
for edge-triggered forwarded interrupts.

The edge-triggered forwarded interrupts code is untested but probably
better to clearly do something wrong and raise a warning.

Changes since v1:
 - Sent out bug fixes for active state and UEFI reset as separate
   patches.
 - Fixed various spelling nits
 - Rewrote proposed documentation file trying to address Eric's and
   Marc's comments
 - Rewrote kvm_timer_update_irq and kvm_timer_update_state according to
   Marc's suggestion (thanks!)
 - Added additional patch to support edge-triggered forwarded
   interrupts.

Christoffer Dall (8):
  KVM: Add kvm_arch_vcpu_{un}blocking callbacks
  arm/arm64: KVM: arch_timer: Only schedule soft timer on vcpu_block
  arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Factor out level irq processing on guest exit
  arm/arm64: KVM: Implement GICD_ICFGR as RO for PPIs
  arm/arm64: KVM: Use appropriate define in VGIC reset code
  arm/arm64: KVM: Add forwarded physical interrupts documentation
  arm/arm64: KVM: Rework the arch timer to use level-triggered semantics
  arm/arm64: KVM: Support edge-triggered forwarded interrupts
