Yes, the signal code now makes use of these via
fpsimd_signal_preserve_current_state() and
fpsimd_update_current_state(), with this patch.

Agreed.  Some BUG_ON()s test for things that are now obviously true
by construction, which was not initially the case during development.
This one can go away.

I'm very interested in any BUG_ON() that you think can actually fire.
There _shouldn't_ be any of those, but the reasons are non-trivial in
some cases.

This is a tricky one -- I suppose I should definitely add comments,
since it took me 2-3 weeks to debug this and get it right the first time
around...

I'm trying to protect against a context switch during the copy_from_user
rewriting stale register data over the data we're copying from the user
signal frame.

In most places, I now disable preemption when writing into thread_struct,
to keep this can of worms firmly closed.

Here though, the code writes directly into thread_struct with
preemption enabled: in this one case the copy is a copy_from_user(),
and we can't disable preemption for that.  Other than this, the reasons
for this code being the way it is derive from Ard's deferred fpsimd
reload machinery (the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE stuff), which is described in
more detail in fpsimd.c.


The reason for the difference from the old fpsimd code here is that the
SVE state may be unreasonably large to bounce via a buffer on the stack,
and the copy-in occurs while the thread is running.  In the ptrace case
(later on) the thread is guaranteed stopped, whereas for fpsimd the
state is small enough that we _can_ bounce it via the stack.

TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE may be cleared by the context switch code, but only
if fpsimd_flush_task_state() wasn't called since the last kernel entry
for current.  (See fpsimd_thread_switch().)

The context switch code may write the CPU registers over thread_struct,
but only if TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is not set at sched-out time.
(fpsimd_thread_switch() again).

These dependencies are strictly intra-thread, since context-switch is
part of the same thread, so

	fpsimd_flush_task_state();
	barrier();
	set_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE);
	barrier();
	copy_from_user(current->thread.sve_state, ...);

should be sufficient.

I prefer to avoid spuriously saving the SVE regs into thread_struct
when they may not already be live, so I don't set TIF_SVE until after
TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set.  (This is a cost saving rather than a
security issue -- only current's state can be in the registers, but the
extra SVE bits are definitely not worth saving.  In any case, it only
makes a difference to context switches in this narrow window.)

The final barrier() isn't really needed, and the ordering of TIF_SVE
with the copy_from_user is unimportant unless I've missed something ...
so I may get rid of that.  TIF_SVE would affect context switch, but
only if TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is clear or a ret_to_user occurs, neither
of which is possible after the second barrier().


Re smp_mb(), the only cross-thread ordering guarantees needed are for
ptrace (later in the series), since that runs in some thread operating
on a stopped thread that may have last run on some other CPU.  But this
is a general ptrace issue, not specifically related to SVE.  IIRC some
interaction between the ptrace core code and the scheduler's
manipulation of the task state and runqueue locks ensures safety in
that case without need for extra smp_mb() all over the place.
