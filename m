OK, I shall look for some other ways to reduce the overhead of world switch.

And another problem might be that, when we start an ARMv7 vm (specify CPU to
be Cortex-A57) on the ARMv8 platform, debug registers will always be saving/loading
because it is always detected that the debug mode is enabled even though we
didn't acutally use it.

Maybe shouldn't in my opinion, because we install/uninstall breakpoints only when
we does context switch, and then we always install/uninstall all the breakpoints.
