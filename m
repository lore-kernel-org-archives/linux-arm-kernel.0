I'm fine with moving these into the header file, but we should probably
revisit this at some point so that we use a shadow value to indicate the
minimum number of registers across the system for e.g. big.LITTLE platforms
that don't have uniform debug resources.

Why not just add the comment with the field in your earlier patch?
