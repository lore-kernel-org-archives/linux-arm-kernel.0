The 1st call to map_resources() maps GICV3 regs and also maps all ITSes.
So I don't think the problem comes from the fact subsequent calls are
inefficient (and return 0) but that for this 1st call to succeeds all
ITS base addresses must have been provided by the userspace. Otherwise
this restoration of this ITS will fail. So this is not explicitly
documented that way in the ABI doc.
