The lazy disable_irq is just an optimization.

The real reason is that if we mask an interrupt on the host, it is
because we don't want the guest to process it at all. There is three cases:

1) The interrupt was inactive: no problem
2) The interrupt was active, but not presented to the guest yet: no
problem either. The interrupt will be taken again on unmask.
3) The interrupt was active and presented to the guest: we might get a
double deactivate, which shouldn't be a big deal (but mostly should not
occur at all).

Would something like this make sense?

On a related note, I wonder if we need to mark the interrupt pending if
it is configured as edge. Otherwise, we could loose an interrupt in case
2 (mask, deactivate, unmask, oh look nothing triggers). Thoughts?

Thanks,
