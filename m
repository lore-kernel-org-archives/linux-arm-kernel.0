If we make page tables read-only, we may need to have multiple levels
of rareness.  Page table writes aren't all that rare, and I can
imagine distros configuring the kernel so that static structs full of
function pointers are read-only (IMO that should be the default or
even mandatory), but page tables may be a different story.

That being said, CR3-twiddling to write to page tables could actually
work.  Hmm.
