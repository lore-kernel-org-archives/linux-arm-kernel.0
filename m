Potentially. We need to be careful about about the semantics of EOI MI
with non-level interrupts (see the other thread about EOI signalling).

I don't think priorities are the issue (after all, we already sort the
irqs in order of priority). My worry is that underflow is allowed to
fire if there is one interrupt pending, which implies that you could
end-up in a livelock scenario if you only have one SGI pending with
multiple sources.

Another possibility would be to use ICH_HCR_EL2.NPIE (GICH_HCR.NPIE on
GICv2), which delivers a a MI if no pending interrupts are present. Once
the SGI has been activated, we're guaranteed to be able to inject a new
pending one.

I like the latter, because it doesn't overload the rest of the code with
new semantics. Thoughts?
