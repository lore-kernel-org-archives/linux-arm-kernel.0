Actually, on second thought, I'm a bit confused by this comment. Maybe
it'll be clearer after the code that goes here will be added, but, ATM,
I'm not sure why we want to specifically load EL1 VCPU state here. Will
that always be the case, even with nested? Also, I'm not sure what
alternative loading scheme we're avoiding in order to ensure the state
isn't "switched around", which I don't really understand either.

Thanks,
