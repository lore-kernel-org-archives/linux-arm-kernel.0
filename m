 Not only KVM, may also kernel sets the fs == KERNEL_DS before calling into world-switch

how about if kernel set the KERNEL_DS? but not the kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run().

KVM and host kernel set_fs(KERNEL_DS) all can break this.
In the normal way, after world-switch, I think it should check whether it needs to restore to its previous state.
we should not always consider the set_fs(KERNEL_DS) is disabled for the host.

No, without VHE, the host kernel is running in the EL1.
Before host kernel enter guest, host OS will call 'HVC' instruction to do the world-switch, and the pstate.PAN will be saved into the SPSR_EL2.
When world-switch back to host kernel from EL2, it will call 'eret' instruction to EL1 host, this 'eret' instruction will restore the SPSR_EL2 to the PSTATE.
so the PSTATE.PAN will be restored.
So without VHE, we should not reset the PAN. I paste the spec statement

------------------------------
PSTATE.PAN is copied to SPSR_ELx.PAN on an exception taken from AArch64 to AArch64
SPSR_ELx.PAN is copied to PSTATE.PAN on an exception return to AArch64 from AArch64

I think we should not always consider the host kernel does not set the KERNEL_DS before entering guest.

No,
for the VHE, both the uao_thread_switch() and current can be accessible from the EL2.
all the host kernel runs in the EL2.
The API can be accessible from EL2 to the VHE.
The current is Qemu or other kvm tools
I have tested this patch, it is workable.
