More importantly, the *architecture* allows non-zero values. The SMCCC
is a *convention*, and not part of the architecture (which is what KVM
is concerned about).

Exactly. PSCI doesn't rely on SMCCC (the initial version pre-dates it),
though it mandates the HVC immediate to be zero. So let's check it
there, and not as a blanket statement forbidding a reasonable use of the
architecture.

Eventually, I'd like to be able to forward such HVC/SMC calls to
userspace (and ultimately deprecate PSCI in the kernel), so that it can
apply whatever policy it decides.

Thanks,
