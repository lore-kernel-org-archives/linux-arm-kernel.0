Subject: [PATCH v6 00/11] arm64: mmu: avoid W+X mappings and re-enable
 PTE_CONT for kernel

Having memory that is writable and executable at the same time is a
security hazard, and so we tend to avoid those when we can. However,
at boot time, we keep .text mapped writable during the entire init
phase, and the init region itself is mapped rwx as well.

Let's improve the situation by:
- making the alternatives patching use the linear mapping
- splitting the init region into separate text and data regions

This removes all RWX mappings except the really early one created
in head.S (which we could perhaps fix in the future as well). Due to
these changes, it is also possible to make another attempt at re-enabling
the use of contiguous mappings at the PMD and PTE levels.

Changes since v5:
- add patch to remove pointless mapping/unmapping of translation table pages
  when the higher level table entry pointing to it is created
- fix unitialized flags var in #9
- allow contiguous ranges for mappings created via create_pgd_mapping (ie., EFI)
- refactor pud/pmd/pte recursion logic so we don't iterate over pmds and ptes
  at two separate levels concurrently (ie., cont and non-cont)
- use macros rather than static inlines for pmd_/pte_cont_addr_end()
- add Mark's R-b to #6 - #9

Changes since v4:
- the PTE_CONT patch has now spawned four more preparatory patches that clean
  up some of the page table creation code before reintroducing the contiguous
  attribute management
- add Mark's R-b to #4 and #5

Changes since v3:
- use linear alias only when patching the core kernel, and not for modules
- add patch to reintroduce the use of PTE_CONT for kernel mappings, except
  for regions that are remapped read-only later on (i.e, .rodata and the
  linear alias of .text+.rodata)

Changes since v2:
  - ensure that text mappings remain writable under rodata=off
  - rename create_mapping_late() to update_mapping_prot()
  - clarify commit log of #2
  - add acks
