OK, I managed to track this down (I think). The issue here is that,
while vmemmap_populate() does the right thing wrt the start and end
boundaries, populate_zero_shadow() will map the adjoining regions down
to page granularity, replacing vmemmap_populate()'s PMD block mappings
with PMD table mappings. So I need to put back the rounding (I removed
it in v4)

Thanks,
Ard.
