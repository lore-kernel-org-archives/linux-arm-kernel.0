the generic header file doesn't declare arch-specific version of api.

The first patch of Kee's series ([PATCH 01/11] Introduce rare_write() infrastructure) [1] says some requirements and one of these is the arch-specific helpers should be inline to avoid making them ROP targets.

So I'd make sure the helpers are inline.

What I did here is just to randomize the base of rw alias mapping when kaslr is enabled.
You're right it's completely independent from kaslr though, I would like to add randomization for rw alias base address by using simple solution in early boot stage.

I' ll think again to achieve randomization or just remove it.

OK, I'll fix this.

I will rebase this onto the version you mentioned later.

Thank you very much for the review
