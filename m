thanks, I will explain more.

I understand you most idea.

But In the Qemu one signal type can only correspond to one behavior, can not correspond to two behaviors,
otherwise Qemu will do not know how to do.

For the Qemu, if it receives the SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR signal, it will populate the CPER
records and inject a SEA to guest through KVM IOCTL "KVM_SET_ONE_REG"; if receives the SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO
signal, it will record the CPER and trigger a IRQ to notify guest, as shown below:

SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR trigger Synchronous External Abort.
SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO trigger GPIO IRQ.

For the SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO and SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR, we have already specify trigger method, which all

not involve _trigger_ an SError.

so there is no chance for Qemu to trigger the SError when gets the SIGBUS_MCEERR_A{O,R}.
