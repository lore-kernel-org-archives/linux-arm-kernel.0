In this case the fault_info is something I have only seen on arm64.
I have been approaching all architectures the same way.

If there is insufficient information without architecture expertise
to fix this class of error I have been ading FPE_FIXME to them.

They are ways I have seen code on other platforms deal with
not information to generate siginfo.  Sending the signal without siginfo
is roughly equivalent to your send SIGKILL suggestion below.

A good example of that is code that calls force_sigsegv.

Calling "force_sig(SIGBUS, current);" is perfectly valid.
And then the parent when it reaped the process would have
a little more information to go on when guessing what happened
to the process.

Yes I would be very happy to see that.

Agreed.  Although I have seen ltp test cases that do crazy things like
that.

No.

I don't expect many userspace applications look at siginfo and
everything I have found is some rare hard to trigger non-x86 case which
limits the exposure to userspace applications tremendously.

The angle I am coming at all of this from is that the linux kernel code
that filled out out struct siginfo was not comprehensible or correct.
Internal to the kernel it was using a magic value (not exportable to
userspace) in the upper bits of si_code.  That was causing problems for
signal injection and converting signals from 32bit to 64bit, and from
64bit to 32bit.

So I wrote kernel/signal.c:siginfo_layout() to figure out which fields
of struct siginfo should be sent to userspace.  In doing so I discovered
that using 0 in si_code (aka SI_USER) is ambiguous, and problematic.

Unfortuantely in most of the cases I have spotted using 0 in the si_code
requires architectural knowledge that I don't currently have to sort
out.  So the best I can do is change si_code from 0 to
FPE_FIXME/BUS_FIXME/TRAP_FIXME and bring the architecture maintainers
attention to this area.

One of the problems that results from all of this is that we copy
unitialized data to userspace.   I am slowly unifying and cleaning the
code up so that the code is simple enough we can be certain we are
not copying unitialized data to userspace.

With si_coes of FPE_FIXME/BUS_FIXME/TRAP_FIXME I can at least attempt to
keep the craziness from happening.

My next step is to unify struct siginfo and struct compat_siginfo
and the functions that copy them to userspace because there are very
siginficant problems there.


All of that said I like the way you are thinking about fixing these
issues.

I would love to see this sorted out.  There is a very similar pattern
on several different architectures.  I suspect if we have a clean
solution on one architecture the other architectures will be able to use
that solution as well.

Yes.   The AR Action Required and AO Action optional bits I don't quite
understand.  But BUS_MCEERR_AR does sound like a good fit.

I like the way you are thinking on these, and I'd love to see them
fixed.
