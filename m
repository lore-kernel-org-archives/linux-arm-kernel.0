Ok!

I'm sure that maintainers and Linus will strongly dislike my patch if I always
use panic() here. panic() kills the whole kernel and we shouldn't use it when we
can safely continue to work.

Let me describe my logic. So let's have size >= stack_left on a thread stack.

1. If CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is enabled, we can safely use BUG(). Even if BUG()
handling overflows the thread stack into the guard page, handle_stack_overflow()
is called and the neighbour memory is not corrupted. The kernel can proceed to live.

2. If CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is disabled, BUG() handling can corrupt the neighbour
kernel memory and cause the undefined behaviour of the whole kernel. I see it on
my lkdtm test. That is a cogent reason for panic().

2.a. If CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK is enabled, the kernel already does panic()
when STACK_END_MAGIC is corrupted. So we will _not_ break the safety policy if
we do panic() in a similar situation in check_alloca().

2.b. If CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK is disabled, the user has some real reasons
not to do panic() when the kernel stack is corrupted. So we should not do it in
check_alloca() as well, just use BUG() and hope for the best.

That logic can be expressed this way:

	if (size >= stack_left) {
#if !defined(CONFIG_VMAP_STACK) && defined(CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK)
		panic("alloca over the kernel stack boundary\n");
#else
		BUG();
#endif

I think I should add a proper comment to describe it.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Alexander
