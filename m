Subject: [PATCH 00/37] Optimize KVM/ARM for VHE systems
Message-ID: <20171012104141.26902-1-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series redesigns parts of KVM/ARM to optimize the performance on
VHE systems.  The general approach is to try to do as little work as
possible when transitioning betwen the VM and the hypervisor.  This has
the benefit of lower latency when waiting for interrupts and delivering
virtual interrupts, and reduces the overhead of emulating behavior and
I/O in the host kernel.

Patches 01 through 04 are not VHE specific, but rework parts of KVM/ARM
that can be generally improved.  We then add infrastructure to move more
logic into vcpu_load and vcpu_put, we improve handling of VFP and debug
registers.

We then introduce a new world-switch function for VHE systems, which we
can tweak and optimize for VHE systems.  To do that, we rework a lot of
the sytem register save/restore handling and emulation code that may
need access to system registers, so that we can defer as many system
register save/restore operations to vcpu_load and vcpu_put, and move
this logic out of the VHE world switch function.

We then optimize the configuration of traps.  On non-VHE systems, both
the host and VM kernels run in EL1, but because the host kernel should
have full access to the underlying hardware, but the VM kernel should
not, we essentially make the host kernel more privieleged than the VM
kernel despite them both running at the same privilege level by enabling
VE traps when entering the VM and disabling those traps when exiting the
VM.  On VHE systems, the host kernel runs in EL2 and has full access to
the hardware (as much as allowed by secure side software), and is
unaffected by the trap configuration.  That means we can configure the
traps for VMs running in EL1 once, and don't have to switch them on and
off for every entry/exit to/from the VM.

Finally, we improve our VGIC handling by moving all save/restore logic
out of the VHE world-switch, and we make it possible to truly only
evaluate if the AP list is empty and not do *any* VGIC work if that is
the case, and only do the minimal amount of work required in the course
of the VGIC processing when we have virtual interrupts in flight.

The patches are based on v4.14-rc2 plus the timer optimization series
[1] and the patches that use the TPIDR_EL2 for per-cpu offsets in the
host kernel and stops storing the VCPU pointer in TPIDR_EL2 from the
SDEI series [2].

I've given the patches a fair amount of testing on Thunder-X, Mustang,
Seattle, and TC2 (32-bit) for non-VHE testing, and tested VHE
functionality on the Foundation model, running both 64-bit VMs and
32-bit VMs side-by-side and using both GICv3-on-GICv3 and
GICv2-on-GICv3.

The paches are also available in the vhe-optimize branch on my
kernel.org repository [3].

Thanks,
-Christoffer
