Subject: [PATCH v4 0/7] Handle forwarded level-triggered interrupts
Message-ID: <1505513994-77939-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>

This series illustrates an alternative approach to Eric Auger's direct EOI
setup patches [1] in terms of the KVM VGIC support.

The idea is to maintain existing semantics for the VGIC for mapped
level-triggered IRQs and also support the timer using mapped IRQs with
the same VGIC support as VFIO interrupts.

Based on v4.13

Changes since v3:
 - Added a number of patches and moved patches around a bit.
 - Check for uaccesses in the mmio handler functions
 - Fixed bugs in the mmio handler functions

Changes since v2:
 - Removed patch 5 from v2 and integrating the changes in what's now
   patch 5 to make it easier to reuse code when adding VFIO integration.
 - Changed the virtual distributor MMIO handling to use the
   pending_latch and more closely match the semantics of SPENDR and
   CPENDR for both level and edge mapped interrupts.

Changes since v1:
 - Added necessary changes to the timer (Patch 1)
 - Added handling of guest MMIO accesses to the virtual distributor
   (Patch 4)
 - Addressed Marc's comments from the initial RFC (mostly renames)

Thanks,
-Christoffer
