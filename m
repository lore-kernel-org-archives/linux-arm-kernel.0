Hmm, I probably am just squawking needlessly. It is indeed hard to 
imagine how callers could be relying on the invalidating the I-cache for 
ordering unless doing something unreasonably stupid, and if the current 
caller is clearly OK then there should be nothing to worry about.

This *has* helped me realise that I was indeed being somewhat thick 
before, because the existing barrier is of course not about memory 
ordering per se, but about completing the maintenance operation. Hooray 
for overloaded semantics...

On a different track, I'm now wondering whether the extra complexity of 
these alternatives might justify removing some obvious duplication and 
letting __flush_cache_user_range() branch directly into 
invalidate_icache_range(), or might that adversely affect the user fault 
fixup path?

Robin.
