!present and !raz is the default behaviour for everything that is not
ID-register-like.  This patch is adding the !present && raz case (though
that may not be a helpful way to descibe it ... see below).

There may be other ways to factor this.  I can't now remember whay I
went with this particular approach, except that I vaguely recall
hitting some obstacles when doing things another way.

Can you take a look at my attempted explanation below and then we
can reconsider this?

To be clear, is this a question about factoring, or do you think there's
a bug here?


In response to both sets of comments, I think the way the code is
factored is causing some confusion.

The idea in my head was something like this:

System register encodings fall into two classes:

 a) encodings that we emulate in some way
 b) encodings that we unconditionally reflect back to the guest as an
    Undef.

Architecturally defined system registers fall into two classes:

 i) registers whose removal turns all accesses into an Undef
 ii) registers whose removal exhibits some other behaviour.

These two classifications overlap somwehat.


>From an emulation perspective, (b), and (i) in the "register not
present" case, look the same: we trap the register and reflect an Undef
directly back to the guest with no further action required.

>From an emulation perspective, (a) and (ii) are also somewhat the
same: we need to emulate something, although precisely what we need
to do depends on which register it is and on whether the register is
deemed present or not.

sys_reg_check_present_or_raz() thus means "falls under (a) or (ii)",
i.e., some emulation is required and we need to call sysreg-specific
methods to figure out precisely what we need to do.

Conversely !sys_reg_check_present_or_raz() means that we can just
Undef the guest with no further logic required.

Does this rationale make things clearer?  The naming is perhaps
unfortunate.
