Subject: [PATCH v5 12/22] arm64: capabilities: Introduce weak features based
 on local CPU
In-Reply-To: <1522073569-29174-1-git-send-email-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

Now that we have the flexibility of defining system features based
on individual CPUs, introduce CPU feature type that can be detected
on a local SCOPE and ignores the conflict on late CPUs. This is
applicable for ARM64_HAS_NO_HW_PREFETCH, where it is fine for
the system to have CPUs without hardware prefetch turning up
later. We only suffer a performance penalty, nothing fatal.
