Then, if you disagree with a proposed design, *explain why* in a
standalone manner.  Say what future uses a different design would
have.

No one has explained how CR0.WP is weaker or slower than my proposal.
Here's what I'm proposing:

At boot, choose a random address A.  Create an mm_struct that has a
single VMA starting at A that represents the kernel's rarely-written
section.  Compute O = (A - VA of rarely-written section).  To do a
rare write, use_mm() the mm, write to (VA + O), then unuse_mm().

This should work on any arch that has an MMU that allows this type of
aliasing and that doesn't have PA-based protections on the
rarely-written section.

It'll be considerably slower than CR0.WP on a current x86 kernel, but,
with PCID landed, it shouldn't be much slower.  It has the added
benefit that writes to non-rare-write data using the rare-write
primitive will fail.
