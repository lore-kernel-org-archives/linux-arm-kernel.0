This needs "coresight: Adding coresight support for arm64
architecture" (https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/2/3/677 ) in order to get
applied. Perhaps that's obvious to the people working on this.

A few comments follow.

I'm _guessing_ that CPU_32v4 and CPU_32v4T are needed for the ldrd and
strd assembler instructions. If that's right a next _guess_ would be
that you also need to mention CPU_32v3 here.

Furthermore, this file is only sourced by arch/arm/Kconfig.debug and
arch/arm64/Kconfig.debug. So 64BIT should always be equal to ARM64 and
the 
     || (64BIT && COMPILE_TEST)

part shouldn't be needed, isn't it?

I spotted no users of readq_relaxed. Is it needed?

bitmap_scnprintf is gone in current linux-next. I changed it to
	len = scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%*pb", STM_ENTITY_MAX,
			drvdata->entities);

to get this file to compile. (On x86_64, that is, but please don't tell
anybody!)
