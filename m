Absolutely.  Forget I asked.

Yes it does.  The only thing that remains a bit unclear is what the
difference between this and kern_hyp_va is, and when you'd choose to use
one over the other.  Perhaps we need a single place which documents our
primitives and tells us what to use when.  At least, I'm for sure not
going to be able to figure this out later on.
