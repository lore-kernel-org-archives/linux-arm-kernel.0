I guess you've misread the case. It's opt-in for large adrress space, not
other way around.

I believe 47-bit VA by default is right way to go to make the transition
without breaking userspace.

That's just if something went wrong and we want to stop an application
from use addresses above 47-bit.

Look at mess in mmap_find_vma(). QEmu has to guess where is free virtual
memory. That's unnessesary complex.

prctl would work for this too. new-mmap would *not*: there are more ways
to allocate vitual address space: shmat(), mremap(). Changing all of them
just for this is stupid.

Except, we need more than mmap as I mentioned.

And what about stack? I'm not sure that everybody would be happy with
stack in the middle of address space.
