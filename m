I believe it does. Take GIC500 for example: it only implements Aff0
(only 8 cores) and Aff1 (32 clusters). Not even Aff2.

I can't see why. What's the point of storing something you can't even
address? Knowing the HW guys, they'd hate to have precious gates just to
serve as an external brain pack for the SW dudes.
