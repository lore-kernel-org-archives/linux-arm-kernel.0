Correction. I understand that vcpu-id is "supposed" to be an arbitrary
identifier now, but it doesn't appear that all the assumptions that it's
a counter are gone yet... virt/kvm/kvm_main.c has

static int kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu(struct kvm *kvm, u32 id)
...
        if (id >= KVM_MAX_VCPUS)
                return -EINVAL;



More to do there I guess...
