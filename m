That's certainly my understanding.  From the ARMv7 ARM the only types of
instruction caches we should worry about are:

 - PIPT instruction caches
 - Virtually-indexed, physically-tagged (VIPT) instruction caches
 - ASID and VMID tagged Virtually-indexed, virtually-tagged (VIVT)
   instruction caches.

And I think that's covered here.
