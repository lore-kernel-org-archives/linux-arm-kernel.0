Subject: [PATCH] asm-generic/pgtable-nop?d.h: define folded with a value for
 use in C
Message-ID: <20181003175052.31917-1-james.morse@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

It turns out "if (__is_defined(__PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED))" isn't equivalent
to "#ifdef __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED". (who knew!)

kconfig.h's __is_defined() expects a define of the form
"#define CONFIG_BOOGER 1". But these nop?d headers just have
"#define __PAGETABLE_PMD_FOLDED".

This means ____is_defined()'s triplet passed to __take_second_arg() is
'empty-string, 1 0' in both cases, meaning these symbols can't be used
from C. (they are always false).

asm-generic gets away with this as its using the pre-processor's
defined() macro on this, not the C __is_defined().

Add the expected '1'.

This fixes an issue with patches queued for arm64. Can it go via the arm64 tree?
