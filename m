Why should it set the irq level to true when the timer cannot fire?

This is just a polling loop which will expire after some time, so it
shouldn't halt the guest indefinitely, but merely slow it down for some
while, if we have a bug.  Is that the behavior you're seeing or are you
seeing the guest coming to a complete halt?

This fix is clearly not correct, as it would prevent forwarding timer
interrupts in some cases.

I actually don't see how the above scenario you painted can happen.

If you're in the polling loop, that means that the timer state is loaded
on the vcpu, and that means you can take interrupts from the timer, and
when you take interrupts, you will set the irq.level.

And here's the first bit of logic in kvm_timer_is_pending():

	if (vtimer->irq.level || ptimer->irq.level)
		return true;

So that would break the loop.

I'm not able to reproduce on my side with a non-VHE platform.

What is the workload you're running to reproduce this, and what is the
exact kernel tree and kernel configuration you're using?

Thanks,
