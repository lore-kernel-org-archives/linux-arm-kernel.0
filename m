May I echo Andre's concern here? Seeing the GICR_PENDBASER registers
here feels wrong. The pending table is a redistributor concept, and is
local to it. Even more, it is perfectly possible to use the
redistributors (and its pending tables) without an ITS by using the
GICR_SETLPIR registers.

Granted, we do not support this (and I'm *not* looking forward to
supporting it), but I would rather implement a redistributor flush than
using the ITS to indirectly force it. That's not how the HW works, and I
don't think we should deviate from it.

I appreciate this brings additional complexity to userspace (having to
iterate over the vcpus or the redistributors is likely more costly than
hitting the ITS which is likely to be unique), but sticking to the
letter of the architecture is probably our best bet. Each time we tried
to deviate from it, we've had to backtrack (and I'm using the royal "we"
here).

Any chance you could revisit this aspect?

Thanks,

	M.
