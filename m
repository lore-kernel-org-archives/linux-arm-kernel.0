Yes, I guess that makes sense.

For SIGKILL, I'm assuming that it is harmless to populate si_addr: even
though not strictly valid, the signal is never delivered to userspace.
Even ptrace cannot see SIGKILL -- the trace just disappears and further
ptrace calls fail with ESRCH.

If is matters, I guess we could prepopulate si_uid = si_pid = 0 for
this case.  That's at least cleaner, so I might do that.


For do_sea:

I was thinking of the fault_info[] table entries as for the fallback
case only, but (a) I also try to use them to affect what do_sea() does
(which, as you observe, doesn't work right now), and (b) there's no
reason why they shouldn't inform what fn does.

So I think you're right.

However, rather than duplicate code I wonder whether we can just
rearrange do_mem_abort() so that the lines

	info.si_signo = inf->sig;
	info.si_errno = 0;
	info.si_code  = inf->code;
	info.si_addr  = (void __user *)addr;

are moved ahead of the call to inf->fn().

This would have the effect of pre-populating info with sane defaults
while still allowing inf->fn() to override them if appropriate.

Thoughts?
