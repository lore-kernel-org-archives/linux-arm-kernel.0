Except on ia64 and frv.  And who knows we might need it on one of those
architectures as well.

I totally understand the temptation.

Long ago in a far off time, we had arch dependent system call numbers
and the like because that provided ABI compatibility with the existing
unix on the platform.

I don't see any of that with the siginfo si_codes.   In most cases
they are arch dependent extensions which is silly.  We should have
unconditionally extended the si_codes for all architectures in case
another architecture needs that si_code.

The fact we now have battling meanings for si_codes depending on the
architecture is an unfortunate mess.

So to me it looks most maintainable going forward to declare that all
si_codes should be allocated generically, from the same number space,
in the same header file.  While we live with the existing historic
mess.

I think new si_codes should be allocated where there are not conflicts
on any architecture.  Just in case they are useful on another
architecture in the future.

What I have tried to do in my merger is discurage the idea that there
are any arch specific si_codes.  To set NSIGXXX to the largest value
from any of the architectures.  And to encourage new si_codes get
allocated after the current NSIGXXX.  So that they will work on all
architectures.

It is all a bit of a mess, but one unified mess seems like the best we
can do right now.
