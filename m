Since these patches are mostly KVM patches I think taking them via the
KVM tree makes the most sense, but they do touch architecture parts of both
arm and arm64.  Are you ok with us merging these via the KVM tree, or do
you prefer some more advanced merge strategy?

The 32-bit arm change is really tiny, but it would be good to have an
ack on patch 1 from the arm64 maintainer.

Thanks,
-Christoffer
