Such a guest would be using a mapping of the same VA with the same ASID
on two separate CPUs, each pointing to a separate PA.  If it ever were
to, say, migrate a task, it would have to do invalidations then.  Right?

Does Linux or other guests actually do this?

I would suspect Linux has to eventually invalidate those mappins if it
wants the scheduler to be allowed to freely move things around.

Yes, the fix is clear, just want to make sure I understand that it's a
valid circumstance where this actually happens.  But in either case, we
probably have to fix this to emulate the hardware correctly.

Another fix would be to allocate a VMID per VCPU I suppose, just to
introduce a terrible TLB hit ratio :)
