The giant switch approach has the advantage that it is likely to be
folded down to a single case when the switch control expression is
const-foldable; the flipside is that when that fails the entire
switch would be inlined.

I guess that makes sense.  I'm still a bit hazy on the big picture
for KVM.

That might not be too bad if there is only one giant inline expansion
and the rest are folded down.


I guess this is something to revisit _if_ we suspect a performance
bottleneck later on.

For now, I was lacking some understanding regarding how this code gets
run, so I was guessing about potential issues rather then proven
issues.

As you might guess, I'm still at the "stupid questions" stage for
this series :)
