The difference is that you'll never need this if the VCPU is running,
this is only when the VCPU is on a waitqueue and sleeping, and therefore
you don't actually need a kick, but you just need to wake up the VCPU
thread.

But kvm_vcpu_kick() also wakes up, it's just a question of using the
most appropriate hammer, making it clear what exactly is going on.

But, as Drew pointed out, we use the request framework to ensure proper
barriers (when he fixes it), after waking up a VCPU, so in this cae it's
to make sure the VCPU thread observed pending_last==true after being
woken up.

Interestingly, we don't need that for the timer, since we don't change
random in-memory values, but we read the physical counter which is the
thing that changes when waking up the thread.

So, sorry for a lot of noise, your code is fine, and Drew fixes KVM, I
think.

Thanks,
