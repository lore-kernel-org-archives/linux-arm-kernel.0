Subject: [PATCH] ARM64: fix building without CONFIG_UID16
Message-ID: <3891403.6hGat7eHq5@wuerfel>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

As reported by Michal Simek, building an ARM64 kernel with CONFIG_UID16
disabled currently fails because the system call table still needs to
reference the individual function entry points that are provided by
kernel/sys_ni.c in this case, and the declarations are hidden inside
of #ifdef CONFIG_UID16:

arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h:57:8: error: 'sys_lchown16' undeclared here (not in a function)
 __SYSCALL(__NR_lchown, sys_lchown16)

I believe this problem only exists on ARM64, because older architectures
tend to not need declarations when their system call table is built
in assembly code, while newer architectures tend to not need UID16
support. ARM64 only uses these system calls for compatibility with
32-bit ARM binaries.

This changes the CONFIG_UID16 check into CONFIG_HAVE_UID16, which is
set unconditionally on ARM64 with CONFIG_COMPAT, so we see the
declarations whenever we need them, but otherwise the behavior is
unchanged.

I would suggest merging this through the arm64 tree, as this is
likely the only architecture that cares about it, and there is little
risk of clashes with other patches in the global headers.

The bug goes back to when arch/arm64 was introduced as far as I can
tell, but I'm not sure if we care about stable backports or not.
I've put stable on Cc anyway, let me know if anyone thinks we should not.
