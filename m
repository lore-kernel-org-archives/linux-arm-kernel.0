Subject: [PATCH 00/18] KVM/arm64: Randomise EL2 mappings
Message-ID: <20171206143839.29223-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Whilst KVM benefits from the kernel randomisation when running VHE,
there is no randomisation whatsoever when the kernel is running at
EL1, as we directly use a fixed offset from the linear mapping.

This series proposes to randomise the offset by inserting a few random
bits between the MSB of the linear mapping and the top of the HYP VA
(VA_BITS - 2). That's not a lot of random bits (on my Mustang, I get
13 bits), but that's better than nothing.

In order to achieve this, we need to be able to patch dynamic values
in the kernel text. This results in a bunch of changes to the
alternative framework, the insn library, cleanups in asm-offsets, and
a few more hacks in KVM itself (we get a new way to map the GIC at
EL2).

This has been tested on the FVP model, Seattle (both 39 and 48bit VA),
Mustang and Thunder-X. I've also done a sanity check on 32bit (which
is only impacted by the HYP IO VA stuff).

Thanks,

	M.
