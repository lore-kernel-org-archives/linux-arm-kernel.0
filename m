Yes, that's right.

AFAICT, arch_timer_ppi_nr could return ARCH_TIMER_PHYS_NONSECURE_PPI
or ARCH_TIMER_PHYS_SECURE_PPI when we're not running at EL2, which would
cause us to use the physical counter with your patch applied.

Assuming you mean get_cycles(), then no, I'm not worried about that because
it's just used for things like small delta calculations and entropy. I'm
worried about the timekeeper (which I think uses arch_timer_read_counter)
being based on the physical counter and the vDSO being based on the virtual
counter and CNTVOFF != 0.

I don't think that solves the problem :(

The PPI selection is more complicated for 32-bit, because of the
"arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured" quirk.
