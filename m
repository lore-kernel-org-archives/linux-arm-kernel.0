The state of CPACR_EL1.ZEN is part of the per-task SVE state in the host,
and needs to be context switched.  This is different from CPACR_EL1.FEN
which is always 0b11 in the host.  KVM currently is unaware of the
context handling on flow in the host though, and corrupts the ZEN field
rather than saving/restoring it.

We could truly save/restore ZEN, but this feels like a misstep: firstly
this only applies to the VHE case so will be a bit ugly, and secondly
I expect context handling cleanup that makes KVM aware of the host
FPSIMD/SVE handling flow will make such save/restore unnecessary, in
any case, the affected ZEN bit is already recorded as the TIF_SVE flag,
so saving it is redundant.

I preferred to keep sve_flush_cpu_state() as the "invalidate any SVE
context cached in the CPU" notification, but if we handle CPACR here
then we need to do this after running the vcpu -- because the hyp
switch code will corrupt the trap state anyway in the VHE case, as a
side effect of disabling traps on vcpu exit.

Alternatively, the hyp trap disable code could be changed to actually
_enable_ SVE traps in the VHE case, but I thought this was both
confusing and tends to hide the real rationale.

I think so -- I didn't want to take the VHE optimisation series into
account yet so I wasn't tracking a moving target, but I think this would
fit naturally there.


All of this is fairly confusing, so if there is a way to make it
clearer, I'd be happy to pick it up...
