Do you mean really BIG FAT or is the above sufficient? (I guess not).
I will make it more prominent.

Just removing it was fine (for GCC 5.3.0, at least).

Mmh, since it (re-)tries quite hard I am not sure _try_ would be
misleading. Basically it queues the IRQ whenever possible and/or
sensible. Having _unlock in it like you suggested in another reply makes
more sense, I think.

There is CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK, but I couldn't find some conditional
debug macro suitable for the purpose. I defined one now for the file
only (since we have quite some users here).

In this case vcpu is always irq->target_vcpu, if I did the math
correctly. So can this be NULL?
Even if this is correct reasoning, I wonder if we optimize something
prematurely here and rely on the current implementation of
vgic_target_oracle(). I think the check for "!vcpu" is here to avoid a
NULL pointer deference below (in the first spin_lock after the retry:
label), so I'd rather keep this explicit check in here.

You lost me here, which hints at the fragility of this optimization ;-)

Mmmh, can you elaborate and sketch a case where the active state would
cause trouble? This check is just here to avoid iterating on a no longer
pending or enabled IRQ. I wonder if an active IRQ can really sneak into
this function here in the first place?

Me neither. Is that because of the case where "kvm_notify_acked_irq
calls kvm_set_irq" (which in turn may call this function)?
I am happy to remove it, also as the old VGIC doesn't seem to have it.

I think this is a copy&paste leftover from the old VGIC with the old way
of handling mapped IRQs. Actually the implementations of
kvm_vgic_inject_irq() and kvm_vgic_inject_mapped_irq() are now
identical, so the former differentiation does not apply anymore. I will
#define the latter to the former for the new VGIC and we should schedule
the removal of the the "mapped" version when the old VGIC gets removed.

Btw: Are we OK with marking those cases which deserve some rework after
the old VGIC is gone with some kind of TODO comments?

Cheers,
Andre.
