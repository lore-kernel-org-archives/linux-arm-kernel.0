The distinction to me is whether this will cause fatal crashes or
exploits down the road if we're working on uninitialized data.  If all
that can happen if the vgic is not initialized, is that the guest
doesn't see interrupts, for example, then a WARN_ON is appropriate.

Which is the case here?

That being said, do we need this at all?  This is in the critial path
and is actually measurable (I know this from my work on the other timer
series), so it's better to get rid of it if we can.  Can we simply
convince ourselves this will never happen, and is the code ever likely
to change so that it gets called with the vgic disabled later?
