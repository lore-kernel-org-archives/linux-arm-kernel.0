Subject: [PATCH 14/45] ARM: dts: at91: at91sam9261: TC blocks are also
 simple-mfd and syscon devices
In-Reply-To: <20171219213209.13823-1-alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>
References: <20171219213209.13823-1-alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>
Message-ID: <20171219213209.13823-15-alexandre.belloni@free-electrons.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Add simple-mfd and syscon to the TC blocks to allow to register one of the
channels as clocksource properly at boot time and free up the remaining
channels for other use.
