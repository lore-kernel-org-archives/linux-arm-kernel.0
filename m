there are two reasons:

1. Let us firstly discuss the SEA and SEI, there are different workflow for the two different Errors.
2. when record the CPER in the user space, it needs to know the error type, because SEA and SEI are different Error source,
   so they have different offset in the APEI table, that is to say they will be recorded to different place of the APEI table.

emulating SEA or SEI is one reason, another reason is that the CPER will be recorded to different place of APEI.

If the guest was not running, host firmware will directly notify EL1 host kernel to handle the error, not notify hypervisor
only if the guest was running host firmware can notify the Error to hypervisor.

If the user space is Qemu, and the error is from Qemu, and guest-memory is not involve.
I will not handle it, please see the code for arm64.

void kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu(CPUState *c, int code, void *addr)
{
    ram_addr_t ram_addr;
    hwaddr paddr;

    ARMCPU *cpu = ARM_CPU(c);
    CPUARMState *env = &cpu->env;
    assert(code == BUS_MCEERR_AR || code == BUS_MCEERR_AO);
    if (addr) {
        ram_addr = qemu_ram_addr_from_host(addr);
        if (ram_addr != RAM_ADDR_INVALID &&
            kvm_physical_memory_addr_from_host(c->kvm_state, addr, &paddr)) {
            kvm_cpu_synchronize_state(c);
            kvm_hwpoison_page_add(ram_addr);
            if (is_abort_sea(env->exception.syndrome)) {
                ghes_update_guest(ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_SEA, paddr);
                kvm_inject_arm_sea(c);
            } else if (is_abort_sei(env->exception.syndrome)) {
                ghes_update_guest(ACPI_HEST_NOTIFY_SEI, paddr);
                kvm_inject_arm_sei(c);
            }
            return;
        }
        fprintf(stderr, "Hardware memory error for memory used by "
                "QEMU itself instead of guest system!\n");
    }

    if (code == BUS_MCEERR_AR) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Hardware memory error!\n");
        exit(1);
    }
}


For the x86, it also does not handle it, it only print "Hardware memory error for memory used by QEMU itself instead of guest system!"

void kvm_arch_on_sigbus_vcpu(CPUState *c, int code, void *addr)
{
    X86CPU *cpu = X86_CPU(c);
    CPUX86State *env = &cpu->env;
    ram_addr_t ram_addr;
    hwaddr paddr;

    /* If we get an action required MCE, it has been injected by KVM
     * while the VM was running.  An action optional MCE instead should
     * be coming from the main thread, which qemu_init_sigbus identifies
     * as the "early kill" thread.
     */
    assert(code == BUS_MCEERR_AR || code == BUS_MCEERR_AO);

    if ((env->mcg_cap & MCG_SER_P) && addr) {
        ram_addr = qemu_ram_addr_from_host(addr);
        if (ram_addr != RAM_ADDR_INVALID &&
            kvm_physical_memory_addr_from_host(c->kvm_state, addr, &paddr)) {
            kvm_hwpoison_page_add(ram_addr);
            kvm_mce_inject(cpu, paddr, code);
            return;
        }

        fprintf(stderr, "Hardware memory error for memory used by "
                "QEMU itself instead of guest system!\n");
    }

    if (code == BUS_MCEERR_AR) {
        hardware_memory_error();
    }

    /* Hope we are lucky for AO MCE */
}

if the dram-scrub hardware spots an error in guest memory, it will generate
IRQ in DDR controller, not SEA or SEI exception. I still do not consider the GSIV.
For GSIV, may be we can only handle it in the host OS.

I think this Error is reported by IRQ(GSIV), GSIV is not SEA/SEI, we should not give the ESR to them.

I do not understand this question.
I think in the process it should report SEA notification when CPU consume the error page.

when user space received the signal, it will judge whether the memory address is user-space (or guest) address

In fact, it can be SEI, not always SEA, why it will always SEA notifications?
If the memory properties of data is device type, it may become SEI notification.

Because of that, so I allow  userspace getting exception information
