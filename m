I saw "KVM_{SET/GET}_DEVICE_ATTR failed: Invalid argument" while using
your QEMU tree (PMU_v2 branch). A quick debugging:

(1) dmesg on host kernel didn't show any vPMU initialization errors. So
I suspect the problem is related to QEMU.
(2) Commit 58771bc2a78 worked fine. So probably the problem was
introduced by new PMU code.

Have you seen it before?

Thanks,
