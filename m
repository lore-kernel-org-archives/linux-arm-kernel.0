I'll add some newlines now to make this cleaner.

/*
 * Read the pseudo-ZCR used by cpufeatures to identify the supported SVE
 * vector length.
 *
 * Use only if SVE is present.
 * This function clobbers the SVE vector length.
 */

OK?

Hmm, this deserves a comment -- coming back to this code, I had to think
about it.  Are the following extra comments sufficient explanation?

	/*
	 * Set the maximum possible VL, and write zeroes to all other
	 * bits to see if they stick.
	 */
	write_sysreg_s(ZCR_ELx_LEN_MASK, SYS_ZCR_EL1);

	zcr = read_sysreg_s(SYS_ZCR_EL1);
	zcr &= ~(u64)ZCR_ELx_LEN_MASK; /* flag up sticky 1s outside LEN field */
	vq_max = sve_vq_from_vl(sve_get_vl());
	zcr |= vq_max - 1; /* set LEN field to maximum effective value */

I'll wait on your responses to the above first.
