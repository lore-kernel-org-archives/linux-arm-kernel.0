Hi Tom,

thanks for looking at the patches!

The idea isn't too bad indeed.
I see that we could use that in vgic_queue_irq_unlock() and
vgic_mmio_write_sactive().
But as Marc mentioned in a conversation yesterday we will have a mixture
of wrapped locks and open coded lock sequences. See for instance
vgic_prune_ap_list(), where we have the sequence, but we can't use
vgic_lock_aplist_irq() because the IRQ lock is taken inside the loop
while the ap_list_lock is taken once outside of it.

Marc, Christoffer, what is your opinion here?

I am not sure this is worth it. We have exactly one user of this
sequence, so I'd rather keep it and the comments there.
Also the use case is probably confined to the core VGIC code.

Cheers,
Andre.
