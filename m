Subject: [PATCH V7 0/7] clk: imx: add imx8qxp clock support
Message-ID: <1542271869-18600-1-git-send-email-aisheng.dong@nxp.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

This patch series adds i.MX8QXP clock support which is based
on the clock service provided by SCU firmware.

Note: It depends on SCU driver which has already been merged by Shawn.
So this patch series could go through Shawn's tree as well.

ChangeLog:
v6->v7:
 * use struct_size()
 * remove MODULE_ macros
 * add more kernel docs/code comments
 * other small improvements
 * update reviewed-by tags
 * add the missing PATCH 1 in V6
v5->v6:
 * simply the driver a lot by re-orgnizing the driver into a few clock types:
   scu clock (merge scu divider/gate/mux) and scu gpr lock which accessing is
   through SCU protocol and LPCG clock which is directly accessible by CPU.
 * LPCG clock is separate from SCU clock, gpr clock is still not used
   and will be added later.
 * remove old year license as the code is totally rewritten
 * scu mux support will be added later as it's also still not used.
v4->v5:
 Address all Stephen and Sascha's review comments, see details in each patch
v3->v4:
 * scu headfile path update
 * no functionality change
v2->v3:
 * structures/enums name update with imx_sc prefix
 * no functionality change
v1->v2:
 * structure and enums name update
 * api usage update due to api change
 * no functionality change
