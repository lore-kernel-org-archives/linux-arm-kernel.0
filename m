The complexity of managing a bi-modal driver seems like far more than a
little bit of code duplication in a device specific reset module and
extends into how userspace makes devices available through vfio, so I
think it's too late for that discussion.

I thought the reason we took the approach we have now is so that we
don't have reset code loaded into the kernel unless we have a device
that needs it.  Therefore we don't really want to preemptively load all
the reset drivers and have them do a registration.  The unfortunate
side-effect of that is the platform code needs to go looking for the
driver.  We do that via the __symbol_get() trick, which only fails
without modules because the underscore variant isn't defined in that
case.  I remember asking Eric previously why we're using that rather
than symbol_get(), I've since forgotten his answer, but the fact that
__symbol_get() is only defined for modules makes it moot, we either need
to make symbol_get() work or define __symbol_get() for non-module
builds.

Otherwise, we should probably abandon the idea of these reset functions
being modules and build them into the vfio platform driver (which would
still be less loaded, dead code than a bi-modal host driver).  Thanks,

Alex
