Yes, I would expect that reset function in a driver is not typically
self contained, probably referencing driver specific data structures for
register offsets, relying on various mappings that are expected to be
created from the driver probe() function, etc.  It also creates a
strange dependency on the host driver, how is the user to know they need
the native host driver loaded for full functionality in a device
assignment scenario?  Are we going to need to do a module_request() of
the host driver in vfio platform anyway?  What if there are multiple
devices and the host driver claims the others when loaded?  In the case
of PCI and SR-IOV virtual functions, I often blacklist the host VF
driver because I shouldn't need it when I only intend to use the device
in guests.  Not to mention that we'd have to drop a little bit of vfio
knowledge into each host driver that we intend to enlighten like this,
and how do we resolve whether the host driver, potentially compiled from
a separate source tree has this support.

I really don't see the layering violation in having a set of reset
functions and some lookup mechanism to pick the correct one.  The vfio
platform driver is a meta driver and sometimes we need to enlighten it a
little bit more about the device it's operating on.  For PCI we have all
sorts of special functionality for reset, but we have a standard to work
with there, so we may need to choose between a bus reset, PM reset, AF
FLR, PCIe FLR, or device specific reset, but it's all buried in the PCI
core code; where device specific resets are the exception on PCI, they
are the norm on platform.

They're separate modules, not drivers.  They simply export a reset
function, no module init or exit function.  A table lookup via the
device compatibility string identifies the module to load and name of
reset function.  At one point I suggested that we simply use standard
naming based on the compatibility string to name the module and reset
function to avoid the table, but that was thought to be too hackish or
perhaps dangerous to have vfio requesting modules like that.

Who would register the reset driver if not the reset "driver" itself?
Either we have a table/list of registered reset drivers and we can pick
the one we want and the code is already loaded, or we have a table/list
of who provides which reset driver and we load and get a pointer when we
determine that we need it.  Are there other options?  Thanks,

Alex
