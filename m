Hi Alex. I have some comments just on the userspace API docs.
These are mostly requests for clarification or expansion, and they
boil down to "if you gave me this API document change I wouldn't be
able to deduce from it the necessary changes to QEMU or kvmtool to
use this functionality".

It's only a _u8 and there's more than 8 IRQ lines -- which ones
can you mask this way?

What values can the timesource field contain?

How are the timers enumerated within the bitmap? Which timers can
be enabled like this?

Shouldn't this be talking about "timers to route to userspace"
rather than "timers to enable", since AIUI the timers are always
enabled regardless of what you set here ?

The KVM_CAP constant name seems rather generic given this is an
obscure corner of the API.


What is the mechanism for the kernel to tell userspace when the
timer *stops* being pending, so it can update the interrupt
level for it in userspace? (What you really want I think is
for the kernel to notify "timer level goes high" and "timer
level goes low" and handle the masking internally.)
