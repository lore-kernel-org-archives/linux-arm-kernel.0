Ok, it's the 'static' word that got me confused. From Mike's explanation
it seems to me that it's the antithesis of static; the master ID
assignment is so dynamic that it's not controllable by the software and
may or may not reflect core id, power state, phase of the moon, etc.

Well, we have the masters attribute with two numbers in it that define
the range of master IDs that the software can choose from. More
specifically to this situation:

 * the number of channel ID spaces available to the SW is
   $end - $start + 1, that is, in your case, just 1;
 * the number of master IDs for the SW to choose from is $end - $start;
 * if $end==$start, their actual numeric value doesn't really matter,
   either for the policy definition or for the actual writers.

This $end==$start situation itself may be ambiguous and can be
interpreted either as having just one *static* master ID fixed for all
SW writers (what I assumed from your commit message) or as having a
floating master ID, which changes of its own accord and is not
controllable by software.

These two situations are really the same thing from the perspective of
the system under tracing. Also, both of these situations should already
work if the driver sets both sw_start and sw_end to the same
value.
