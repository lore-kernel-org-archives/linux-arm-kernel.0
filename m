Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/5] arm/arm64: Making HYP vgic/timer save/restore common
Message-ID: <1453996565-19666-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

With the current state of the C conversion of arm and arm64 world
switches, we are still unable to share some of the most obvious
candidates (GIC and timer save/restore). In order to reduce the bloat,
let's move these files to a common location (virt/kvm/arm/hyp).

The changes are extremely mechanical, with a small hack to deal with
system register names on the 32bit side (I've decided to align on the
64bit names).

I'd like to know what people think of the common location. Does it
makes sense to have a "hyp" subdirectory to indicate that this is not
"normal" kernel code?

These patches are on top of 4.5-rc1, plus the VHE and 32bit WS rewrite
patches, and I've pushed out a branch at

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maz/arm-platforms.git kvm-arm64/mov-hyp
