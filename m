Subject: [PATCH 2/4] mm/hugetlb: Enable arch specific huge page size support
 for migration

Architectures like arm64 have HugeTLB page sizes which are different than
generic sizes at PMD, PUD, PGD level and implemented via contiguous bits.
At present these special size HugeTLB pages cannot be identified through
macros like (PMD|PUD|PGDIR)_SHIFT and hence chosen not be migrated.

Enabling migration support for these special HugeTLB page sizes along with
the generic ones (PMD|PUD|PGD) would require identifying all of them on a
given platform. A platform specific hook can precisely enumerate all huge
page sizes supported for migration. Instead of comparing against standard
huge page orders let hugetlb_migration_support() function call a platform
hook arch_hugetlb_migration_support(). Default definition for the platform
hook maintains existing semantics which checks standard huge page order.
But an architecture can choose to override the default and provide support
for a comprehensive set of huge page sizes.
