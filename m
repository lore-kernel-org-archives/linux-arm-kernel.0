um, nice changelog, but it didn't tell us what the patch actually does.

AFACIT it arranges for the kernel to execute the trap instruction even
when CONFIG_BUG=n?  Can't be bothered fully working it out, really.

It also makes mystery changes to WARN_ON() and WARN().  What are those?

Also, you say "it avoids the warnings".  To what warnings do you refer?
The ones which are already emitted by CONFIG_BUG=n, or new ones which
would have been added had this patch been implemented differently?

Finally, code-size decreases are nice, but what are the runtime effects
of this patch?

I've been thinking for a while that CONFIG_BUG=n is a pretty dumb thing
to do, and that maintaining it (and trying to fix the warnings it
produces) aren't worth the effort and that we should remove the whole
thing.  Perhaps your patch changes that calculus, dunno.  Please discuss.
