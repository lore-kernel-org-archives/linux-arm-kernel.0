Subject: [PATCH 3/4][v4] ARM: dts: Add NOR connection type with IFC
Message-ID: <20180215115054.23747-1-prabhakar.kushwaha@nxp.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Connection between IFC and NOR flash is of big-endian type.

So add big-endian property in flash node to reflect the same.
