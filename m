One last thing to watch out for: If you're trying to build a kernel that 
mixes clocksource support with get_arch_timeoffset, you'll need to 
rework the #ifdef in update_wall_time(), since we currently assume with 
get_arch_timeoffset() that you're using tick + interpolation, so every 
call to update_wall_time() only moves time forward by one jiffy.

Otherwise, thanks for the name tweak. Going through the arm-soc tree is 
fine with me.
