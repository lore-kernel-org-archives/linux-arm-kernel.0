Given that this is a shift value, I think the help message could be more
informative. Something like:

	"Specify maximum number of bits in a guest physical address"

I think I'd actually leave out any mention of memory, because this does
actually have an effect on the amount of addressable memory in a way that I
don't think we want to describe in half of a usage message line :)
