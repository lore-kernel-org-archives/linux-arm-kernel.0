Yes; I'd meant s/tagged/untagged/.

I've corrected this to:

/*
 * The EL0 pointer bits used by a pointer authentication code.
 * This is dependent on TBI0 being enabled, or bits 63:56 would also apply.
 */

I must've generated this patch before I corrected this; my local branch
(and kernel.org) have 0x406 here.

Sorry about that.

Mark.
