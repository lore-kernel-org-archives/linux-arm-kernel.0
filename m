I was trying to keep the number of instructions to a minimum in
preference to potentially slightly faster sequence (I haven't done any
benchmarks). On ARMv8.1+ implementations, we just end up with more nops.

We could also do an ldr from a PC-relative address, it's one instruction
and it may not be (significantly) slower than MRS + ADD.

If we get preempted between reading current_thread_info()->ttbr0 and
writing TTBR0_EL1, a series of context switches could lead to the update
of the ASID part of ttbr0. The actual MSR would store an old ASID in
TTBR0_EL1.

The reason for this is that thread_info.ttbr0 is conditionally defined.
I don't think the compiler would ignore it.

This looks better. Minor comment, I would actually name the ending
statement alternative_else_nop_endif to match the order in which you'd
normally write them.

I'll try to move it somewhere where it can be included in vmlinux.lds.S
(I can probably include cpufeature.h directly).
