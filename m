I probably chose the wrong name for this feature (write rarely).
That's _usually_ true, but "sensitive_write()" was getting rather
long. The things that we need to protect with this are certainly stuff
that doesn't get much writing, but some things are just plain
sensitive (like page tables) and we should still try to be as fast as
possible with them.

I'll try to include a third example in the next posting of the series
that makes this more obvious.

I'm all for a general case for the infrastructure (as Andy and Mark
has mentioned), but I don't want to get into the situation where
people start refusing to use it because it's "too slow" (for example,
see refcount_t vs net-dev right now).
