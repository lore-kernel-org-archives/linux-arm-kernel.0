If it is not a problem for ARM, maybe it would actually be best to leave
the locking in kvm_vcpu_ioctl (with the already existing exception of
KVM_INTERRUPT).  This would make vcpu_load void, and would also let you
keep the PID adjustment in common code.  This would be more similar to
the previous version, but without introducing __vcpu_load/__vcpu_put.

Looks good apart from this doubt!  Thanks,

Paolo
