I had a chance to discuss this patchset with SteveR and PeterZ at LPC
and both don't like the idea of introducing notifications on perf trace
event [un]registration.

Peter suggested using the PMU interface to expose this functionality. As
we want to monitor TLB instructions for for each VM, this will require
creating a PMU per-VM. The PMU events can be extended in the future if
monitoring of additional operations is supported and required.

I'll post the next version with the above changes - please chime-in if
you disagrees with this approach.

Thanks,
Punit
