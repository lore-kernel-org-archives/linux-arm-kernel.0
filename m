The rationale is simply that as we're developing code, if we start
accessing registers while the sysregs are still loaded on the CPU, which
we haven't accessed before, and don't have an accessor for (new sysregs,
rework other parts of the flow etc.,), I wanted to have a clear point
where we realize that we forgot something.  Especially if we mostly test
on non-VHE systems.

But, actually, BUG() may be too hard, as it would only ever affect the
VM, and not the host, so reads could be WARN+RAZ, and writes could be
WARN+WI.
