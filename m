Coming back to this one, annoyingly, it doesn't seem to work.  This is
the code I use for get_host_ctxt:

.macro get_host_ctxt reg, tmp
	adr_l	\reg, kvm_host_cpu_state
	mrs	\tmp, tpidr_el2
	add	\reg, \reg, \tmp
	kern_hyp_va \reg
.endm

And this is the disassembly for one of the uses in the hyp code:

	adrp	x0, ffff000008ca9000 <overflow_stack+0xd20>
	add	x0, x0, #0x7f0
	mrs	x1, tpidr_el2
	add	x0, x0, x1
	and	x0, x0, #0xffffffffffff
	
For comparison, the following C-code:

	struct kvm_cpu_context *host_ctxt;
	host_ctxt = this_cpu_ptr(&kvm_host_cpu_state);
	host_ctxt = kern_hyp_va(host_ctxt);

Gets compiled into this:

	adrp	x0, ffff000008ca9000 <overflow_stack+0xd20>
	add	x0, x0, #0x7d0
	mrs	x1, tpidr_el1
	add	x0, x0, #0x20
	add	x0, x0, x1
	and	x0, x0, #0xffffffffffff

And, during hyp init we do:
	mrs	x1, tpidr_el1
	msr	tpidr_el2, x1

Any ideas what could be going on here?

Thanks,
