I think we should. We so far rely on the fact that the compiler won't be
stupid enough to generate a constant pool load to compute an address
that it can reach using PC-relative addressing, but you never know.

The issue is that the kernel is linked at a particular VA, and we run it
at another. This hasn't much to do with randomization.

Seems sensible.
