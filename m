We are using DMA-Engine framework for both SG mode and BOX mode of our HW.
For SG mode we are using device_prep_dma_sg API but the problem we are 
facing is we need to pass command configuration parameter along with 
each descriptor to our HW, we did not find any suitable API/structure in 
framework to support this.
So thought of adding new element in struct scatterlist.
please can you suggest a way to pass private parameter with
every descriptor.

Yes this interleaved pattern.

We are doing interleaved pattern of data transfer between source and 
destination boxs, num_list is number of box mode commands
Please can you refer patch 0/2 I have replied explaining about box mode 
transfer clearly.
