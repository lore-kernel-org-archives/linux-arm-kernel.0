I'll check this -- sounds about right.

If is should never happen, should I just delete that code or BUG()?  I
notice a BUG_ON() for a similar situation in access_vm_reg() for example.

Or do we not quite trust hardware not to get this wrong?
(It feels like the kind of thing that could slip through validation
and/or would be considered not worth a respin, but it seems wrong to
work around a theoretical hardware bug before it's confirmed to exist,
unless we think for some reason that it's really likely.)

This "raz" overloading already seems present in other places, such as the
cpufeatures code.  (Which is not necessarily a good reason for adding
more of it...)

So, point taken, but the main reason for making this a table was to make
it easy to see by eye how the entries map to the encoding while hacking
this up, which helped me to make sure no entries were missed or in the
wrong place etc.

With 3 entries per line that visual map is lost, and with 2 entries per
line it's debatable whether it's worth having multiple entries per line
at all.

So now that the table exists maybe we should just have one entry per
line like everything else -- it really depends on which option you think
is best for ongoing maintenance.


Having one per line allows much less cryptic names, allowing the
temptingly short but ambiguous "RAZ" to be avoided:

	ID_SANITISED(ID_ISAR5),
	ID_RAZ_FOR_GUEST(ID_AFR0),
	ID_UNALLOCATED(crm, op2)

With a whole line and different lengths, it's easier to pick out
the different cases by eye, so they don't all look like IDRXX (and are a
more tasteful colour perhaps).

Blank lines and/or comments can split the list into sensible blocks for
readability if needed.

If you're happy with naming along those broad lines then I'm happy to
see what it looks like.

There are no sysreg definitions for IA_AA64AFR{0,1}_EL1 yet.

If we want to macroise those rather than just commenting, I guess
they'll need adding in sysreg.h.  I'd prefer not to imply these are
"unallocated" or similar when the architecture does define them.

Can I take it there's no problem with zombie entries in sysreg.h so long
as they're at least referenced somewhere?  (Arguably they wouldn't be
zombies then, but hopefully you see what I mean.)

Can do.  Making this a one-liner doesn't buy us an awful lot.
