You have to be careful here.  We've been through this with ioremap_wt()
which is incorrect for ARM as things stand at the moment (I have patches
which adds documentation on this issue, and fixes ioremap_wt().)

The question is whether the allocated memory may have unaligned accesses
performed on it - either intentionally, or unintentionally (eg, by GCC
inlining memcpy().)

If the answer to that question is yes or possibly yes, neither ioremap()
nor ioremap_nocache() (which is, unfortunately, the same as ioremap() due
to various documentation telling people to use it for devices) can be used
for the mapping on ARM.

So we can't go around adding new ioremap() variants and hoping that
ioremap_nocache() is a safe default everywhere.  It isn't.

I see you've been bitten by the gnome-terminal cut'n'paste bug with all those
space characters above. ;)

Surely, if architectures can support the different variants, then they
should implement them?

The only case where it makes sense to provide boilerplate for these is
when architectures don't support the mapping type - and then we need help
from architecture people to decide what is the appropriate mapping type
(and therefore which ioremap() variant) to be used as a fallback.
