Hi Catalin,

I think we agree w.r.t. the code you suggest. I just disagree with the
suggestion that using mem= for carveouts is something we must, or even
could support -- it's already fragile.

More on that below.

Sure. My point was there were other reasons this is extremely fragile
currently, regardless of KASLR. For example, due to reservations
occurring differently.

Consider that when we add memory we may shave off portions of memory due
to page size, as we do in early_init_dt_add_memory_arch. Regions may be
fused or split for other reasons which may change over time, leading to
a different amount of memory being shaved off.

Afterwards memblock_enforce_memory_limit figures out the max address to keep
with:

        /* find out max address */
        for_each_memblock(memory, r) { 
                if (limit <= r->size) {
                        max_addr = r->base + limit;
                        break;
                }    
                limit -= r->size;
        }

Given all that, you cannot use mem= to prevent use of some memory, except for a
specific kernel binary with some value found by experimentation.

I think we need to make it clear that this is completely and hopelessly broken,
and should not pretend to support that.

As above, I do not think this is safe at all across kernel binaries.

I'm happy with the logic you suggest for the purpose of keeping low DMA
memory.

I think we must make it clear that mem= cannot be used to protect or
carve out memory -- it's a best effort tool for test purposes.

Thanks,
Mark.
