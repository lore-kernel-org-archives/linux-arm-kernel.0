Ok, I got it.

I should have put this in the previous patch, and I'll do that.

Just let you know, WARN_ON() in the previous patch was there because I
thought that the caller of this function is sure that one of the
timers are able to fire. But I think that's beyond the scope of this
function.

I don't have a good answer for this, so I'll get back to you!

We can do that, but I think that's not necessary. Firing the physical
timer while a vcpu is unloaded doesn't affect the task scheduling. Or
is it awkward to do so?

As far as I remember, it worked. I agree that it's simpler.
But as I mentioned in the patch [8/8] reply this *may* cause more overhead.
