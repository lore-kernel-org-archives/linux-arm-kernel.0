VTCR_EL2.PS (and please use capital letters to designate a field in a
given register).

Now that you've reduced the flags to be the reserved bits only, why not
clean it up for good, and directly use TCR_EL2_RES1? Also, that comment
is pretty pointless, as the whole of TCR_EL2 is now dynamically
configured, not just the PS field.

Otherwise look OK to me.
