I understand all this.  What I'd like for us to find out is why we are
having coherency issues.  We knew that for the VGA adapter, the guest
maps the memory as uncached (because that's how the real hardware
works), and QEMU maps the memory as cached (because it's just normal
memory), and unsurprisingly the two views of that memory is not
coherent.

What are the cases you are seeing with e1000 or usb-ehci?

Hint: We can make a lot of things work by just sticking cache flushes
all over, but it's not a good engineering approach.

Thanks,
