Let's rewind a bit, because I've long lost track of what you're trying
to do to handle what.

You need two signals:

(1) TIMER_LEVEL: the output of the timer line, having accounted for the
IMASK bit. This is conveniently the value of timer->irq.level.

(2) TIMER_IRQ_MASK: an indication from userspace that a timer interrupt
is pending, and that the physical line should be masked.

You need a number of rules:

(a) On exit to userspace, the kernel always exposes the value of
TIMER_LEVEL.

(b) On kernel entry, userspace always exposes the required
TIMER_IRQ_MASK, depending on what has been exposed to it by TIMER_LEVEL.

(c) If on guest exit, TIMER_LEVEL==1 and TIMER_IRQ_MASK==0, perform a
userspace exit, because the emulated GIC needs to make the interrupt
pending.

(d) If on guest exit, TIMER_LEVEL==0 and TIMER_IRQ_MASK==1, perform a
userspace exit, because the guest has disabled its timer before taking
the interrupt, and the emulated GIC needs to retire the pending state.

and that's it. Nothing else. The kernel tells userspace the state of the
timer, and userspace drives the masking of the physical interrupt.
Conveniently, this matches what the current code does.

The I bit is a mask, just like any other exception bit in PSTATE. So
you're *enabling* interrupts here. But let's assume the interrupts are
disabled, as they are in an interrupt handler.

So what is this "vcpu line"? HCR_EL2.VI? The timer interrupt through the
GIC? The timer output line?

And?

Rule (a) should apply, always. Whether it is pending or not depends on
what userspace decides to do. If userspace doesn't play ball, the guest
will keep exiting.

At this stage, I don't have any understanding of what you're trying to
do. I've given you what I think needs to be implemented, please let me
know if that matches your understanding.
