I think I don't need the get and put at all, which would allow to
totally drop the vgic_put_irq_locked version:
1) We have the lpi_list_lock, so if we find the IRQ in the list, it's
still valid (we free it only after having it removed).
2) It can't be removed without dropping the lock.
3) We just store the number, not the pointer.
4) An LPI can be unmapped anyway after we dropped the lock and before we
actually use the copy. We take care of that already by calling get again
and coping with a NULL return.

So is it feasible to remove the get and put here completely or is that
dodgy since we technically use the reference?
Shall I document that one doesn't need get and put if holding the
lpi_list_lock?

Cheers,
Andre.
