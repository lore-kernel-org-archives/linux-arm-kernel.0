yes, I think wanted to write now, not not.

the kvm exit api is designed without regard for how anything in-kernel
works.  Since the work we were doing was leveraging some of the handling
that pointed to the anonymous struct from user-space, we just copied its
definition.

For the purposes of this series, the struct is just private vgic
parameter passing now.  You just use the struct kvm_exit_mmio pointer
inside the vgic code to call the range handlers.  You don't have to do
that, you can just define your own struct, call it vgic_mmio_params or
whatever, and instead of it having a data array, it now has a data
pointer.

What I think you'll find is that our need for struct kvm_exit_mmio then
goes away, because it is superseeded by what the kvm dev io bus thingy
now uses, and with some clever pattern matching the code should be
fairly trivial, with the worst part being changing the pointer type in
some places.

If it blows up and I missed something, we can leave this for a future
optimization, but it doesn't sound all that scary to me.
