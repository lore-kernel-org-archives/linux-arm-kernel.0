Sure, I will use S2 everywhere.

Sorry for the confusion in the numbering of levels and the lack of comments.

Taking the above example in the description, with 16K.


ARM ARM entry

no. of
levels     4     3         2         1         0

vabits : [47] [46 - 36] [35 - 25] [24 - 14] [13 - 0]
             ^       ^    ^
             |       |    |
       host entry    |    x---- stage-2 entry
                     |    |
            IPA -----x    x----- HYP_PGTABLE_SHIFT


1) ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT(x) gives the size a level 'x' entry can map.

e.g, PTE_SHIFT => ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT(1) => PAGE_SHIFT = 14
      PMD_SHIFT => ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT(2) => (PAGE_SHIFT - 3) + PAGE_SHIFT = 25
      PUD_SHIFT => ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT(3) => 36

and so on.

Now we get HYP_PAGETABLE_LEVELS = 2

To calculate the number of concatenated entries, we need to know the total size(HYP_PGTABLE_SHIFT)
that can be mapped by the hyp(stage2) page table with HYP_PGTABLE_LEVELS(2). It is
nothing but the size mapped by a (HYP_PGTABLE_LEVELS + 1) entry.
i.e, ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT(3) = 36 ( = 39 for 4K)

We can use that to calculate the number of concatenated entries, by :

	KVM_PHYS_SHIFT - HYP_PGTABLE_SHIFT

Numbering of the levels is a bit confusing. The ARM ARM numbers levels from the top bits,
while we could end up using the levels in the reverse order. Hence

#define HYP_PGTABLE_ENTRY_LEVEL (4 - HYP_PGTABLE_LEVELS)

could also create confusion. I will get rid of that and just use HYP_PGTABLE_LEVELS.

Thanks
