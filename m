Yup, that would work as well. The only nit is that the pointer needs to be
in the __hyp_text section, and my compiler is shouting at me with this:

  CC      arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/switch.o
arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/switch.c: In function '__hyp_call_panic_vhe':
arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/switch.c:298:13: error: __hyp_panic_string causes a section type conflict with __fpsimd_enabled_nvhe
 const char *__hyp_panic_string __section(.hyp.text) = "HYP panic:\nPS:%08llx PC:%016llx ESR:%08llx\nFAR:%016llx HPFAR:%016llx PAR:%016llx\nVCPU:%p\n";
             ^
arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/switch.c:22:24: note: '__fpsimd_enabled_nvhe' was declared here
 static bool __hyp_text __fpsimd_enabled_nvhe(void)

Any clue?
