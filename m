Ok, thanks for the analysis, I had missed that and was about to
send a different patch to increase STRUCT_PAGE_MAX_SHIFT
in some configurations, which is not as good.

You could add further text here that I had just added to my
patch description (not sent):

    Further experiments show that the build error already existed before,
    but was only triggered with larger values of CONFIG_NR_CPU and/or
    CONFIG_NODES_SHIFT that might be used in actual configurations but
    not in randconfig builds.

    With longer CPU and node masks, I could recreate the problem with
    kernels as old as linux-4.7 when arm64 NUMA support got added.

    Fixes: 1a2db300348b ("arm64, numa: Add NUMA support for arm64 platforms.")
    Fixes: 3e1907d5bf5a ("arm64: mm: move vmemmap region right below
the linear region")

I tested it on two broken configurations, and found that you have
a typo here, it should be 'ifdef', not 'ifndef'. With that change, it
seems to build fine.
