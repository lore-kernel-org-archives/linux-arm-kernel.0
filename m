Subject: [RFC PATCH 3/8] arm64: thread_info remove stale items
In-Reply-To: <1473947349-14521-1-git-send-email-mark.rutland@arm.com>

We have a comment claiming __switch_to() cares about where cpu_context
is located relative to cpu_domain in thread_info. However arm64 has
never had a thread_info::cpu_domain field, and neither __switch_to nor
cpu_switch_to care where the cpu_context field is relative to others.

Additionally, the init_thread_info alias is never used anywhere in the
kernel, and will shortly become problematic when thread_info is moved
into task_struct.

This patch removes both.
