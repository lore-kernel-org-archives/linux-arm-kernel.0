What I meant was: setting the rlimit to anything other than -1ULL is a
workaround, but otherwise I agree.  This still makes little sense if
set by PAM or other conventional rlimit tools.

But CAP_SYS_RESOURCES still makes no sense in this context.

Fair enough.

Except that mmap-via-int80, shmat-via-int80, etc should still work (if
I understand what qemu needs correctly), as would the prctl.

I would, personally.  I think that, for very large address spaces, we
should allocate a large block of stack and get rid of the "stack grows
down forever" legacy idea.  Then we would never need to worry about
the stack eventually hitting some other allocation.  And 2^57 bytes is
hilariously large for a default stack.
