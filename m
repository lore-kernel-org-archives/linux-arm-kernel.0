From: Christoffer Dall <cdall@linaro.org>

We are about to add an additional soft timer to the arch timer state for
a VCPU and would like to be able to reuse the functions to program and
cancel a timer, so we make them slightly more generic and rename to make
it more clear that these functions work on soft timers and not the
hardware resource that this code is managing.

The armed flag on the timer state is only used to assert a condition,
and we don't rely on this assertion in any meaningful way, so we can
simply get rid of this flack and slightly reduce complexity.

Notes:
    Changes since v3:
     - Removed the armed flag from the timer
     - Don't accept a null pointer to soft_timer_cancel(), this will be
       introduced when used in later patches.
