Subject: [PULL 24/28] KVM: arm/arm64: Handle CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED

From: James Morse <james.morse@arm.com>

cpu_pm_enter() calls the pm notifier chain with CPU_PM_ENTER, then if
there is a failure: CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED.

When KVM receives CPU_PM_ENTER it calls cpu_hyp_reset() which will
return us to the hyp-stub. If we subsequently get a CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED,
KVM does nothing, leaving the CPU running with the hyp-stub, at odds
with kvm_arm_hardware_enabled.

Add CPU_PM_ENTER_FAILED as a fallthrough for CPU_PM_EXIT, this reloads
KVM based on kvm_arm_hardware_enabled. This is safe even if CPU_PM_ENTER
never gets as far as KVM, as cpu_hyp_reinit() calls cpu_hyp_reset()
to make sure the hyp-stub is loaded before reloading KVM.
