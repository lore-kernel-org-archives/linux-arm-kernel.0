I've ran a slightly heavier set of tests, and the infamous reboot loop
broke, thanks to patch #7.

Notice how we fail to wipe the vgic_apr copy on the "light" exit path?
If you're unlucky (and odds are that you will be), you will inject an
interrupt while its active priority bit is set, and the new interrupt
won't be delivered. Bah.

With that fixed, the reboot loop has been going strong for a few hours.
I'll leave my Seattle cooking overnight and if everything looks good in
the morning, I'll repost a new set of patches.

Thanks,

	M.
