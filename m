I'm not saying anything about *decisions*. I'm saying that we can make
the state consistent by advancing the singlestep state in the same way
that HW does, at the instant it advances the PC.

i.e. do that in kvm_skip_instr(), as I've done in my local tree.

That mirrors the HW, and we don't need to special-case any handling for
emulated vs non-emulated instructions.

So long as we consistently advance the singlestep state when we emulate
an instruction, we shouldn't need kvm_arm_handle_step_debug() at all. If
we emulate an instruction, we'll return to the guest with PSTATE.SS
clear, and the HW will generate the exception for us.

This is *vastly* simpler to reason about.

I have local patches which I intend to post shortly.

At the very least we need to define whether the kernel or userspace is
responsible for this. If we say it's userspace's responsibility to
virtualize this when it takes control of guest debug, but QEMU doesn't
do so, that's fine by me.

Providing the architecturally mandated behaviour to the guest.

It's not just about GDB. Things like kprobes, live patching, etc in a
guest may use singlestep, and this may be *critical* to the correct
operation of a given guest.

People *will* want to debug such features under a hypervisor. I know
that I personally want to be able to do so.

In general, a debugger shouldn't silently corrupt guest state or
behaviour, as KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP behaviour effectively does today.

Thanks,
Mark.
