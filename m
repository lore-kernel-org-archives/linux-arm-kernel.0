Subject: [RFC 00/55] Nested Virtualization on KVM/ARM

Nested virtualization is the ability to run a virtual machine inside another
virtual machine. In other words, it???s about running a hypervisor (the guest
hypervisor) on top of another hypervisor (the host hypervisor).

This series supports nested virtualization on arm64. ARM recently announced an
extension (ARMv8.3) which has support for nested virtualization[1]. This series
is based on the ARMv8.3 specification.

Supporting nested virtualization means that the hypervisor provides not only
EL0/EL1 execution environment with VMs as it usually does, but also the
virtualization extensions including EL2 execution environment with the VMs.
Once the host hypervisor provides those execution environment with the VMs,
then the guest hypervisor can run its own VMs (nested VMs) naturally.

To support nested virtualization on ARM the hypervisor must emulate a virtual
execution environment consisting of EL2, EL1, and EL0, as the guest hypervisor
will run in a virtual EL2 mode.  Normally KVM/ARM only emulated a VM supporting
EL1/0 running in their respective native CPU modes, but with nested
virtualization we deprivilege the guest hypervisor and emulate a virtual EL2
execution mode in EL1 using the hardware features provided by ARMv8.3 to trap
EL2 operations to EL1. To do that the host hypervisor needs to manage EL2
register state for the guest hypervisor, and shadow EL1 register state that
reflects the EL2 register state to run the guest hypervisor in EL1. See patch 6
through 10 for this.

For memory virtualization, the biggest issue is that we now have more than two
stages of translation when running nested VMs. We choose to merge two stage-2
page tables (one from the guest hypervisor and the other from the host
hypervisor) and create shadow stage-2 page tables, which have mappings from the
nested VM???s physical addresses to the machine physical addresses. Stage-1
translation is done by the hardware as is done for the normal VMs.

To provide VGIC support to the guest hypervisor, we emulate the GIC
virtualization extensions using trap-and-emulate to a virtual GIC Hypervisor
Control Interface.  Furthermore, we can still use the GIC VE hardware features
to deliver virtual interrupts to the nested VM, by directly mapping the GIC
VCPU interface to the nested VM and switching the content of the GIC Hypervisor
Control interface when alternating between a nested VM and a normal VM.  See
patches 25 through 32, and 50 through 52 for more information.

For timer virtualization, the guest hypervisor expects to have access to the
EL2 physical timer, the EL1 physical timer and the virtual timer. So, the host
hypervisor needs to provide all of them. The virtual timer is always available
to VMs. The physical timer is available to VMs via my previous patch series[3].
The EL2 physical timer is not supported yet in this RFC. We plan to support
this as it is required to run other guest hypervisors such as Xen.

Even though this work is not complete (see limitations below), I'd appreciate
early feedback on this RFC. Specifically, I'm interested in:
- Is it better to have a kernel config or to make it configurable at runtime?
- I wonder if the data structure for memory management makes sense.
- What architecture version do we support for the guest hypervisor, and how?
  For example, do we always support all architecture versions or the same
  architecture as the underlying hardware platform? Or is it better
  to make it configurable from the userspace?
- Initial comments on the overall design?

This patch series is based on kvm-arm-for-4.9-rc7 with the patch series to provide
VMs with the EL1 physical timer[2].

Git: https://github.com/columbia/nesting-pub/tree/rfc-v1

Testing:
We have tested this on ARMv8.0 (Applied Micro X-Gene)[3] since ARMv8.3 hardware
is not available yet. We have paravirtualized the guest hypervisor to trap to
EL2 as specified in ARMv8.3 specification using hvc instruction. We plan to
test this on ARMv8.3 model, and will post the result and v2 if necessary.

Limitations:
- This patch series only supports arm64, not arm. All the patches compile on
  arm, but I haven't try to boot normal VMs on it.
- The guest hypervisor with VHE (ARMv8.1) is not supported in this RFC. I have
  patches for that, but they need to be cleaned up.
- Recursive nesting (i.e. emulating ARMv8.3 in the VM) is not tested yet.
- Other hypervisors (such as Xen) on KVM are not tested.

TODO:
- Test to boot normal VMs on arm architecture
- Test this on ARMv8.3 model
- Support the guest hypervisor with VHE
- Provide the guest hypervisor with the EL2 physical timer
- Run other hypervisors such as Xen on KVM
