The first four patches are already applied there.

Damnit.  I read that every function called by user_exit, and none of
them give any indication of why they're needed for traced syscalls but
not for untraced syscalls.  On a second look, it seems that TIF_NOHZ
controls it.  I'll update the code to call user_exit iff TIF_NOHZ is
set.  If that's still wrong, then I don't see how the current code is
correct either.

I don't follow.  If TIF_SINGLESTEP, then phase1 will return a nonzero
value, and phase2 will set TF.

I admit I don't really understand all the TF machinations.
