Yes, at least at the moment. The spec does not specify how ITS errors
should be communicated (IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED), only that an error
condition itself can be signaled via an SError - for which atm we lack
any code to inject, if I am not mistaken.
Still I wanted to assign those error codes: IMHO it improves readability
and simplifies any later extension in that respect.

For the Linux errors (like -ENOMEM): Due to the asynchronous nature of
the ITS command handling and also the guest triggering the commands,
there is really no better way to report those OoM conditions, for
instance, so I treated them the same as "proper" ITS errors.

Hope that helps.
Cheers,
Andre.
