Subject: [Patch v4 0/5] Introduce keystone reset driver
Message-ID: <1400682454-24535-1-git-send-email-ivan.khoronzhuk@ti.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

These patches introduce keystone reset driver.

The keystone SoC can be rebooted in several ways. By external reset
pin, by soft and by watchdogs. This driver allows software reset and reset
by one of the watchdogs. Also added opportunity to set soft/hard reset type.

Based on linux-next/master
