Sorry I did not have time to review the series properly. My
understanding is we generally care about migration between different
kernels. For the ITS, we made the IIDR writable too to manage the ABI
version properly. See ab01c6bdacc43c41c6b326889f4358f5afc38bf9. But
maybe I missed the crux of the matter.
