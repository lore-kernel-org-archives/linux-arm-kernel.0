yep. This is not done that way in QEMU for both gicv2 and gicv3.

Besides the KVM device doc is not that detailed, and I am the one to blame:
    KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT
      request the initialization of the VGIC or ITS, no additional
parameter in kvm_device_attr.addr.

yes makes sense. Currently I am not using the qemu framework (basically
the  kvm_arm_register_device function that both vgic v2 and v3 are
using) but I am using a custom machine init done callback. Now  I am not
yet 100% sure this will not break something else ;-)

my own callback implements the sequence you describe above.
