ouch.

I wasn't aware that softirqs would use fpsimd.

I can't see this working, what if an IRQ comes in and a softirq gets
pending immediately after local_bh_enable() above?

And as you say, it's really not pretty.

This is really making me think that I'll drop this part of the
optimization and when we do optimize fpsimd handling, we do it properly
by integrating it with the kernel tracking.

What do you think?
