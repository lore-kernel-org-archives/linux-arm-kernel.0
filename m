Will makes the point over on patch 11 that until we have different handling for
these different classifications of error, there isn't much point doing this now.
(i.e. we treat an error generated here, or when we enter the guest in the same way).

I was trying to keep my eye on what we need for kernel-first support, so we
don't have to change the code twice, we just expand the error handling to do better.

I'll drop this patch for now, it will come back if/when we get kernel-first
support for RAS.


What about firmware-first? Firmware can always take these errors when the normal
world is running. Dropping the barrier means its up to the CPU when any error
gets reported, if firmware has to use NOTIFY_SEI it will have to do a reboot if
the error occurs during world-switch (as SError is masked). If an error spreads
over this boundary, that's just tough-luck, the kernel would have panic'd anyway.


Sorry for the noise,


Thanks,

James
