-fpic almost guarantees you will get position dependent but runtime
relocatable code (i.e., symbol references indirected via GOT entries
which need to be fixed up at runtime etc), unless you play around with
hidden visibility etc. For the same reason, the EFI stub does not
support being built with -fpic either.

Adding -mcmodel=small explicitly is much more likely to do anything
meaningful here, but only in case we need to set it to 'large'
globally in the future.
