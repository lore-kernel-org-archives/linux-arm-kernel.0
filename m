FWIW, I gave this a try, this doesn't look to bad. I carried the new
type down till virt/kvm/arm/vgic.c:kvm_set_routing_entry(), where the
EXTENDED type got turned back into the normal MSI type while setting the
flag in the internal struct kvm_kernel_irq_routing_entry. This keeps the
new type only to the userland facing side, with the kernel code staying
mostly the same.
Together with a new KVM_CAP_MSIS_REQUIRE_DEVID capability I can now
drive both GICv2M and ITS emulation from the same userland base in a
sane manner.
If someone wants to have a look now, tell me, otherwise I will wait for
Eric's upcoming code drop and comment on that then.

Cheers,
Andre.
