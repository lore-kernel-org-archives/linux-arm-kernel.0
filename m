I agree that where possible we should minimize the amount of work required of
bootloaders. I'm not sure that the percentage of work we might be able to trim
away on hardware would be significant, but on simulators I think we might be
able to get to the point where, if you can specify the r0 reset value to be
the dtb pointer, you can just load a devicetree blob and kernel image into
memory and start executing the kernel, no boot wrapper required.

I don't know if Jean-Christophe was commenting on just the EL1PCTEN bit or
also the CNTFRQ register, but with regard to the latter, it appears to me that
the timer code actually reads the frequency primarily from the devicetree and
only reads CNTFRQ if the "clock-frequency" property is unspecified or
specified as zero.

I suggest that the kernel calling requirements be modified to communicate this
fallback, rather than mandatory, status, unless some not-yet-released part of
the arm64 kernel needs it. If userspace code will need to use CNTFRQ at some
point then perhaps that should be mentioned in an informational note rather
than being presented as a kernel booting requirement.

The UART and GIC stuff is board-specific, and I don't currently have any
suggestions about the multicore initialization, but would you object to the
kernel eventually being equipped to make the descent from EL3 itself?

Thanks,
Christopher
