No, x86 CONFIG_VMAP_STACK only kills the offending process. I see it on my deep
recursion test, the kernel continues to live. handle_stack_overflow() in
arch/x86/kernel/traps.c calls die().

Ok!

I see CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK enabled by default in Ubuntu config...

I think it's not a question of performance here. There are cases when a system
must live as long as possible (even partially corrupted) and must not die
entirely. Oops is ok for those systems, but panic (full DoS) is not.

It's too tough for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK on x86 - the system can proceed to live.
Anyway, the check_alloca() code will not be shared between x86 and arm64, I've
described the reasons in this thread. So I can have BUG() for CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
on x86 and Laura can consistently use panic() on arm64.

Let me keep BUG() for !CONFIG_SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK. I beware of using panic()
by default, let distro/user decide this. I remember very well how I was shouted
at, when this one was merged:

Mark, I'm really grateful to you for such a nice code review!
