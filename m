Let me see if I follow:

AT S1E1 at EL1 should only generate a fault if the page table walking
itself generates a fault (the guest page tables have been swapped out),
and the fault is taken to EL2. At that point, that's a normal
translation fault, which EL2 can easily resolve and restart the AT
instruction. This is in fact no different from a faulting load/store.

Doing the same thing at EL2 would simply indeed indicate a failed
translation, and not generate a fault, which I think is what you're
observing. After all, it is the hypervisor that unmapped those pages, it
might as well properly track what is happening.

It is a bit of an odd case because the AT here is executed at vEL2
(EL1), and trapped to EL2 because of the NV bits. If it wasn't trapped,
everything would just work. In this case, I can't see any other way but
to walk the S1PT by hand, having put all the other vcpus on hold to
avoid concurrent modifications... Yes, this sucks. If only AT could do
partial walks...

The saving grace is that this only happens in the unmapped S1PT case.
The above can be used as a fallback if the AT S1 from EL2 actually fails.

See J1.1.5 in the ARMv8 ARM Rev B.a, and the various comments indicating
how this applies to Address Translation instructions. There is also some
description of what is expected from the AT instructions in D4.2.11.
