1st the device regions are created. 2d they are attached at some place
in the guest memory PA address space. 2d is what I call "region
mapping". and 3d you have the kvm_device_ioctl(kd->dev_fd,
KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR, attr) called, setting the ITS base address on
kernel side. This is done on the so-called machine_init_done_notifier.
So if we follow that scheme the explicit INIT must happen after 3).

No similarly the GICv3 base addresses are provided to the kernel very
late (at the same place as 3, on machine init notifier). for VGIC the
CTRL_INIT is called at device creation 1), after freezing the number of
SPIs. if you look at the vgic_init function that is called upon
CTRL_INIT, it never uses base addresses. It just uses dimensionning
parameters such as the number of SPIs. for VGIC, the map_resources is
called implicitly on first vcpu run, ie. after 3). For ITS with current
patch this needs to be done on a machine_init_done_notifier after 3).

 So are you concerned that

Well I don't think we need to devise the kernel API according to the
QEMU framework. However from a kernel pov I wanted to shed the light on
the difference between vgic_init and its_init which are not homogeneous
in terms of actions and map_resources which in one case is called
implicitly and in the other case must be called explicitly, with impact
on qemu framework.
