Userspace will always read the line-level values out and write
them back for migration, and I'd rather not make it have to
do cross-checks against whether the interrupt is edge or level
triggered to see whether it should write the level values into
the kernel. Telling the kernel the level for an edge-triggered
interrupt should be a no-op because it doesn't have any effect
on pending status.

IIRC the QEMU code restores the config first. (There's a similar
ordering thing for GICv2 where we have to restore GICD_ICFGRn before
GICD_ISPENDRn.)
