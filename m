Ok, I see.

Ok, so there is already a working driver for these chips, but you want
to move to a better driver and binding. That's all fine, but I'm not sure
about why you want to do this faster at all. Presumably you want to use
the new driver quickly so you can add new platforms not using the old
driver, but then you'd have a couple of years of grace period before
removing the old driver for customers with existing out of tree dts files,
so I would assume that waiting another release or two before moving
the DT files over is not adding a huge burden.

That would certainly be helpful, yes.
