Not really. I already mentioned that one a while ago:

http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2015-March/332249.html

The first page of GIC is aliased over the first 64kB, and the second 
page aliased over the second 64kB. So you get a consistent mapping if 
you use (base + 0xF000) to address GICC. Also, the DT that's in 
mainline is showing a 4kB CPU interface, which doesn't enable 
EOImode==1. You must be using a firmware that's newer than mine, since 
I'm perfectly able to boot my Mustang with these patches.

The main problem here is not to update the binding, but the fact that 
you *cannot* update the DT on x-gene (the firmware will replace your 
GIC node with what it thinks it is), and the APM guys can't be bothered 
to fix their stuff.

In the meantime, can you give the following patch a shot? My Mustang is 
wired to a 4kB CPU interface, so I'll need your help to test it.

Thanks,

	M.

Subject: [PATCH] irqchip/GIC: Add workaround for aliased GIC400

The GICv2 architecture mandates that the two 4kB GIC regions are
contiguous, and on two separate physical pages. This doesn't work
very well when PAGE_SIZE is 64kB.

A relatively common hack to work around this is to alias each 4kB
region over its own 64kB page. Of course in this case, the base
address you want to use is not really the begining of the region,
but base + 60kB (so that you get a contiguous 8kB region over two
distinct pages).

Normally, this would be describe in DT with a new property, but
some HW is already out there, and the firmware makes sure that
it will override whatever you put in the GIC node. Duh. And of course,
said firmware source code is not available, despite being based
on u-boot.

The workaround is to detect the case where the CPU interface size
is set to 128kB, and verify the aliasing by checking that the ID
register for GIC400 (which is the only GIC wired this way so far)
is the same at base and base + 0xF000. In this case, we update
the GIC base address and let it roll.

And if you feel slightly sick by looking at this, rest assured that
I do too...
