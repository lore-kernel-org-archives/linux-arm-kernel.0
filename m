r12 (aka ip) is allowed to be clobbered by the linker (used by inserted
code veneers, for example). Given that this is a standalone object, we
can safely assume that r12 has been saved if it was used by the caller.

Here is what the PCS says:

"Register r12 (IP) may be used by a linker as a scratch register between
a routine and any subroutine it calls (for details, see
?5.3.1.1, Use of IP by the linker). It can also be used within a routine
to hold intermediate values between subroutine calls."
