As I explained above:

If Qemu received SIGBUS_MCEERR_AR, it will record CPER and trigger Synchronous External Abort;
If Qemu received SIGBUS_MCEERR_AO, it will record CPER and trigger GPIO IRQ;
So Qemu does not know when to _trigger_ an SError.

so here I "return a error" to Qemu if ghes_notify_sei() return failure in [1], if you opposed KVM "return error",
do you have a better idea about it? thanks

About the way of migrating pending SError, I think it is a separate case, because Qemu still does not know
how and when to trigger the SError.

[1]:
static int kvm_handle_guest_sei(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_run *run)
{
        .......................
+       case ESR_ELx_AET_UER:   /* The error has not been propagated */
+               /*
+                * Userspace only handle the guest SError Interrupt(SEI) if the
+                * error has not been propagated
+                */
+               run->exit_reason = KVM_EXIT_EXCEPTION;
+               run->ex.exception = ESR_ELx_EC_SERROR;
+               run->ex.error_code = KVM_SEI_SEV_RECOVERABLE;
+               return 0;
        .......................
