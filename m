In the moment we return an error when the bit is not set. But
theoretically a guest could have other (in-kernel emulated) MSI
controllers which don't require a device ID, though currently there is none.
The reason for both the KVM capability and the flag on the ioctl is for
mutual assurance that both userland and the kernel know about this ITS
specific extension.
This KVM_SIGNAL_MSI API is rather generic, so I don't want to
unnecessarily slam the door on other emulated ITS controllers.
