Subject: [PATCH 21/37] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Update documentation of the GIC
 devices wrt IIDR
In-Reply-To: <20180813145755.16566-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>

From: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@arm.com>

Update the documentation to reflect the ordering requirements of
restoring the GICD_IIDR register before any other registers and the
effects this has on restoring the interrupt groups for an emulated GICv2
instance.

Also remove some outdated limitations in the documentation while we're
at it.
