This doesn't have to be ASID tagged. Actually, it is more likely to
affect global mappings. Imagine for example that the kernel (which uses
global mappings for its own page tables) decides to create per-cpu
variable using this trick (all the CPUs have the same VA, but use
different PAs). No invalidation at all, everything looks perfectly fine,
until you start virtualizing it.

Linux may hit it with CPU hotplug, which uses global mappings (which a
vcpu using an ASID tagged mapping could then hit if the VAs overlap).

But that would break TLB invalidations that are broadcast in the Inner
Shareable domain. To do so, you'd have to trap every TBLI, and issue
corresponding invalidations for all the vcpus. I'm not sure I want to
see the performance number of that solution... ;-)
