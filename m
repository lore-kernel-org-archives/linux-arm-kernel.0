Indeed it looks like interrupts are enabled during cpu_init_hyp_mode,
and if it's possible to be preempted there or if kdump can be initiated
from interrupt context, this could go wrong, so you're probably right
that we need to support a common hyp-ABI for the kernel hyp stub, the
KVM stub (a.k.a. the trampoline code), and KVM's hyp layer itself.
