In-Reply-To: <20160907042908.6232-1-takahiro.akashi@linaro.org>

From: James Morse <james.morse@arm.com>

Add documentation for
	linux,crashkernel-base and crashkernel-size,
	linux,elfcorehdr
used by arm64 kexec/kdump to decribe the kdump reserved area, and
the elfcorehdr's location within it.

 book3e) by some versions of kexec-tools to tell the new kernel that it
 is being booted by kexec, as the booting environment may differ (e.g.
 a different secondary CPU release mechanism)

+linux,crashkernel-base
+linux,crashkernel-size
+----------------------
+
+These properties (currently used on PowerPC and arm64) indicates
+the base address and the size, respectively, of the reserved memory
+range for crash dump kernel.
+e.g.
+
+/ {
+	chosen {
+		linux,crashkernel-base = <0x9 0xf0000000>;
+		linux,crashkernel-size = <0x0 0x10000000>;
+	};
+};
+
+linux,elfcorehdr
+----------------
+
+This property (currently used only on arm64) holds the memory range,
+the address and the size, of the elf core header which mainly describes
+the panicked kernel's memory layout as PT_LOAD segments of elf format.
+e.g.
+
+/ {
+	chosen {
+		linux,elfcorehdr = <0x9 0xfffff000 0x0 0x800>;
+	};
