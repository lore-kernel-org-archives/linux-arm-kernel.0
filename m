My idea was that we reserve a large block of register IDs for this
purpose.  This means that we can say in advance what the semantics
of these registers are going to be, and ensure plenty of expansion
room.

Can we solve this by pre-allocating a block of registers for future
allocation: they all become RAZ, and writes are permitted provided that
the value written to each field satisfies our usual comparison rule
(every field must be written with <= 0 in this case).

This is what I had in mind.

Yes, that's a concern.

We could just allocate a single register with these semantics, but
use it as a template for future expansion if it turns out that we
need more fields.  We'll know pretty soon how fast the number of
fields is likely to grow.

My point is, we are introducing a scheme whether we like it or not.

Perhaps we could do this, but make it explicit that these regs hold
KVM private metadata that userspace is not expected to interpret, say

	KVM_REG_ARM_PRIVATE_1
	KVM_REG_ARM_PRIVATE_2
	// ...

which will be listed by KVM_GET_REG_LIST, but with no #defines in the
UAPI headers, except perhaps to identify these IDs as a class (i.e.,
userspace can see it's in the KVM_REG_ARM_PRIVATE_ space, but it's
told what a given ID means).

Source and destination node might understand different numbers of such
registers: we'd need a way to handle this (or at least to guarantee that
the mismatch is detected).

We could have a helper to do this.  I agree it's marginally uglier than
working with unsigned fields, we could probably use
cpuid_feature_extract_signed_field() to achieve the same.

I agree that this is bikeshedding though, and it doesn't matter one way
or the other unless there is some other compelling argument.

Cheers
