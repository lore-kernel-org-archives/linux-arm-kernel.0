Subject: [PATCH v5 00/40] Optimize KVM/ARM for VHE systems
Message-ID: <20180227113429.637-1-cdall@kernel.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series redesigns parts of KVM/ARM to optimize the performance on
VHE systems.  The general approach is to try to do as little work as
possible when transitioning between the VM and the hypervisor.  This has
the benefit of lower latency when waiting for interrupts and delivering
virtual interrupts, and reduces the overhead of emulating behavior and
I/O in the host kernel.

Patches 01 through 06 are not VHE specific, but rework parts of KVM/ARM
that can be generally improved.  We then add infrastructure to move more
logic into vcpu_load and vcpu_put, we improve handling of VFP and debug
registers.

We then introduce a new world-switch function for VHE systems, which we
can tweak and optimize for VHE systems.  To do that, we rework a lot of
the system register save/restore handling and emulation code that may
need access to system registers, so that we can defer as many system
register save/restore operations to vcpu_load and vcpu_put, and move
this logic out of the VHE world switch function.

We then optimize the configuration of traps.  On non-VHE systems, both
the host and VM kernels run in EL1, but because the host kernel should
have full access to the underlying hardware, but the VM kernel should
not, we essentially make the host kernel more privileged than the VM
kernel despite them both running at the same privilege level by enabling
VE traps when entering the VM and disabling those traps when exiting the
VM.  On VHE systems, the host kernel runs in EL2 and has full access to
the hardware (as much as allowed by secure side software), and is
unaffected by the trap configuration.  That means we can configure the
traps for VMs running in EL1 once, and don't have to switch them on and
off for every entry/exit to/from the VM.

Finally, we improve our VGIC handling by moving all save/restore logic
out of the VHE world-switch, and we make it possible to truly only
evaluate if the AP list is empty and not do *any* VGIC work if that is
the case, and only do the minimal amount of work required in the course
of the VGIC processing when we have virtual interrupts in flight.

The patches are based on v4.16-rc3 with kvmarm/next and kvmarm/master
applied on top.

I've given the patches a fair amount of testing on Thunder-X, Mustang,
Seattle, and TC2 (32-bit) for non-VHE testing, and tested VHE
functionality on TX2 and on the foundation model.

The patches are also available in the vhe-optimize-v5 branch on my
kernel.org repository [1].  The vhe-optimize-v5-base branch contains
prerequisites of this series.

Patches 36, 38, and 40 are missing Acked-by or Reviewed-by tags.

Changes since v4:
 - Rebased on v4.16-rc3 and other patches queued for kvmarm/next.
 - Mostly cosmetic, detailed changelogs are in the individual patches.
 - Patch 13 introduces an additional ISB on return from the VHE run
   function which we lost now when we no longer call the kvm_call_hyp()
   wrapper which used to take care of that for us.

Changes since v3:
 - Rebased on v4.16-rc1 (fun!)
 - Removed VFP optimizations because it was discovered that the deferred
   approach taken in v3 was buggy
   (https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/kvmarm/2018-February/029838.html)
   This causes a fair amount of changes throughout and I've removed
   affected reviewed-by and other tags as best I could to take this into
   account.
 - Used a switch-statement to handle deferred system registers instead
   of the macro approach taken in v3.
 - Addressed other review coments (tried to keep track of this with logs
   of changes in individual patches).
 - I ran Yury's IPI benchark test and other tests on TX2 and could not
   observe a performance regression, but rather an improvement of around
   65%.  I suspect the previous regression was due to the timer WFI
   problem solved for v4.16-rc1.
 - I haven't included Tomasz' reviewed-by, because I figured too much of
   the series has changed since v3.

Changes since v2:
 - Rebased on v4.15-rc3.
 - Includes two additional patches that only does vcpu_load after
   kvm_vcpu_first_run_init and only for KVM_RUN.
 - Addressed review comments from v2 (detailed changelogs are in the
   individual patches).

Thanks,
