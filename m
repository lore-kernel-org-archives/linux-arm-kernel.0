Hi all,

(Sorry if there is similar discussion, and I missed it. I didn't
find something in LKML in last half a year.)

In aarch64/ilp32 discussion Catalin wondered why we don't pass offset
in mmap() as 64-bit value (in 2 registers if needed). Looking at kernel
code I found that there's no generic interface for it. But almost all
architectures provide their own implementations, like this:

SYSCALL_DEFINE6(mips_mmap, unsigned long, addr, unsigned long, len,
                unsigned long, prot, unsigned long, flags, unsigned long,
                fd, off_t, offset)
{
        unsigned long result;

        result = -EINVAL;
        if (offset & ~PAGE_MASK)
                goto out;

        result = sys_mmap_pgoff(addr, len, prot, flags, fd, offset >> PAGE_SHIFT);

out:
        return result;
}

On glibc side things are even worse. There's no mmap() implementation
that allows to pass 64-bit offset in 32-bit architecture. mmap64() which 
is supposed to do this is simply broken:
void *
__mmap64 (void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, int fd, off64_t
                offset)
{
        [...]
        void *result;
        result = (void *) INLINE_SYSCALL (mmap2, 6, addr,
                                         len, prot, flags, fd,
                                         (off_t) (offset >> page_shift));
        return result;
}

It explicitly declares offset as 64-bit value, but casts it to 32-bit
before passing to the kernel, which is wrong for me. Even if arch has
64-bit off_t, like aarch64/ilp32, the cast will take place because
offset is passed in a single register, which is 32-bit.

I see 3 solutions for my problem:
1. Reuse aarch64/lp64 mmap code for ilp32 in glibc, but wrap offset with
SYSCALL_LL64() macro - which converts offset to the pair for 32-bit
ports. This is simple but local solution. And most probably it's enough.

2. Add new flag to mmap, like MAP_OFFSET_IN_PAIR. This will also work.
The problem here is that there are too much arches that implement
their custom sys_mmap2(). And, of course, this type of flags is
looking ugly.

3. Introduce new mmap64() syscall like this:
sys_mmap64(void *addr, size_t len, int prot, int flags, int fd, struct off_pair *off);
(The pointer here because otherwise we have 7 args, if simply pass off_hi and
off_lo in registers.)

With new 64-bit interface we can deprecate mmap2(), and generalize all
implementations in kernel.

I think we can discuss it because 64-bit is the default size for off_t 
in all new 32-bit architectures. So generic solution may take place.

The last question here is how important to support offsets bigger than
2^44 on 32-bit machines in practice? It may be a case for ARM64 servers,
which are looking like main aarch64/ilp32 users. If no, we can leave
things as is, and just do nothing.
