The guest can't do any recover either. There is no recovery you can do without
some information about what the error is.

This is your memory corruption at an unknown address? We should reboot.

(I agree memory_failure.c's::me_kernel() is ignoring kernel errors, we should
try and fix this. It makes some sense for polled or irq notifications, but not
SEA/SEI).

No. Host user space should not know anything about the kernel or platform RAS
support. Doing so creates an ABI link between EL3 firmware and Qemu. This is
totally unmaintainable.

This thing needs to be portable. The kernel should handle the error, and report
any symptoms to user-space. e.g. 'this memory is gone'.

We shouldn't special case KVM.

The last Signed-off-by should match the person posting the patch. It's a chain
of custody for GPL-signoff purposes, not a 'partially-written-by'. If you want
to credit Quanming Wu you can add CC and they can Ack/Review your patch.

This has to claim the SError as a notification. If APEI claims the error, KVM
doesn't need to do anything more. You ignore its return code.

We should not pass RAS notifications to user space. The kernel either handles
them, or it panics(). User space shouldn't even know if the kernel supports RAS
until it gets an MCEERR signal.

You're making your firmware-first notification an EL3->EL0 signal, bypassing the OS.

If we get a RAS SError and there are no CPER records or values in the ERR nodes,
we should panic as it looks like the CPU/firmware is broken. (spurious RAS errors)
