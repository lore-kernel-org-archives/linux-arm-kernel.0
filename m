Hi Andy,

I am really sorry for delay.

This is on top of the recent change from Kees, right? Could me remind me
where can I found the tree this series based on? So that I could actually
apply these changes...

This looks suspicious, but perhaps I misread this change.

If I understand correctly, syscall_trace_enter() can avoid _phase2() above.
But we should always call user_exit() unconditionally?

And we should always set X86_EFLAGS_TF if TIF_SINGLESTEP? IIRC, TF can be
actually cleared on a 32bit kernel if we step over sysenter insn?

Oleg.
