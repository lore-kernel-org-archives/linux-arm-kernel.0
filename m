I have thought about it, which means to say, "Since we can't find
whether the guest has any hwbrpts enabled from the DBGDSCR, why
don't we find it from the DBGBCR and DBGWCR?".

Case 1: The host and the guest enable all the hwbrpts.
It's necessary to world switch the debug registers all the time.

Case 2: The host and the guest enable some of the hwbrpts.
It's necessary to world switch the debug registers which are enabled.
But if we want skip thouse registers which aren't enabled, we have to 
keep track of all the debug states both in the host and the guest.
We need to judge which debug registers we should switch, and which 
not. It may bring in a complex logic in the assembly code. And if the
host or guest enabled almost all of the hwbrpts, this operation may
bring in the loss outweights the grain.
Is it acceptable and worthy? If yes, I will do it.

Case 3: Neither the host nor the guest enable any hwbrpts.
It's the case that we can skip the whole world switch thing.
The only problem is that we have to read all the debug registers on each
guest entry to find whether the host enable any hwbrpts or not.
But this case is a normal case, which is worthy to do the efforts to
reduce the saving/restoring overhead.
