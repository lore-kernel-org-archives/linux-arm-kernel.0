Patch 6 is implicated in the rework - it will cause big.Little systems
to either have the workaround applied when it isn't required or not
applied when it is required.  It depends which CPU is the boot CPU.

For example, a big.Little A7/A15 cluster - if the boot CPU is an A15,
then we will use the ICIALLI switch_mm method for both the A15 and A7.
If the boot CPU is an A7, then we will use the standard switch_mm
method that does not contain the workaround even for the A15, and the
A15 will then be vulnerable.

I don't think we have a way to identify if we boot on a big.Little
system, so the kernel messages could claim to have the workarounds,
but they won't be effective.

This is the hardest one to solve, because it means more invasive
changes to deal with the MM switching paths, which need to become
per-cpu.  The problem is, there are times that we call into that
path but the per-cpu variables are not accessible (because the CPU
isn't initialised sufficiently for them to work.)

It's trivial to solve the issues in the later patches by comparison.
