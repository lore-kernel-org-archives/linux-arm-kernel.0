I really wonder if it is possible to have a clean implementation of 
dma_map_ops based and linear inlined dma-mapping framework together.
Theoretically it should be possible, but it will end with a lot of
#ifdef hackery which is really hard to follow and understand for 
anyone but the authors.

Even in coherent case, the overhead caused by additional function call
should have really negligible impact on drivers performance.

I'm fine with both of them. Even arm_linear_dma_ops make some sense.

They are used by the dma bounce code once converted to dma_map_ops framework.
