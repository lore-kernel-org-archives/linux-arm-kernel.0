Theoretically, yes, but we're saved by two things:

First, this is only ever called on PPIs from the timer code, which are
always statically allocated as part of the VCPU.

Second, this isn't actually needed anymore after the irqchip in
userspace support, which partially reworked the timer init sequence
(done after the first version of these patches), so this patch could
actually have been entirely dropped, or reworked as you suggest.

Thanks,
