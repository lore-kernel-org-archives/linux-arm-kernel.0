Yes, I'm aware of this and I will include such changes in the next version
of my patches.

Right, this should be quite simple. I will also add DMA_ATTR_NON_COHERENT
attribute for implementing dma_alloc_noncoherent() call.

IMHO it will be better to hide the CMA from the drivers. Memory allocated
from CMA doesn't really differ from the one allocated by dma_alloc_coherent()
(which internally use alloc_pages()), so I really see no reason for adding
additional attribute for it.
