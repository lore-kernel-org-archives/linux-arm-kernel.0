Could you have a look at the following changes in check_alloca() before I send
the next version?

If VMAP_STACK is enabled and alloca causes stack depth overflow, I write to
guard page below the thread stack to cause double fault and VMAP_STACK report.

If VMAP_STACK is disabled, I use MIN_STACK_LEFT = 2048, which seems to be enough
for BUG_ON() handling both on x86_32 and x86_64. Unfortunately, I can't
guarantee that it is always enough.


 #ifdef CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_STACKLEAK
-#define MIN_STACK_LEFT 256
+#define MIN_STACK_LEFT 2048

 void __used check_alloca(unsigned long size)
 {
        unsigned long sp = (unsigned long)&sp;
        struct stack_info stack_info = {0};
        unsigned long visit_mask = 0;
        unsigned long stack_left;

        BUG_ON(get_stack_info(&sp, current, &stack_info, &visit_mask));

        stack_left = sp - (unsigned long)stack_info.begin;
+
+#ifdef CONFIG_VMAP_STACK
+       /*
+        * If alloca oversteps the thread stack boundary, we touch the guard
+        * page provided by VMAP_STACK to trigger handle_stack_overflow().
+        */
+       if (size >= stack_left)
+               *(stack_info.begin - 1) = 42;
+#else
        BUG_ON(stack_left < MIN_STACK_LEFT ||
                                size >= stack_left - MIN_STACK_LEFT);
+#endif
 }
 EXPORT_SYMBOL(check_alloca);
 #endif


Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Alexander
