A big thank you for reading through it :-).

This looks like a useful optimisation; I'll have a think about workloads that
fire many futexes on THP tails. (The test I used only fired off one futex).

We need this logic if we want use fast_gup on normal pages safely. The special
bit indicates that we should not attempt to take a reference to the underlying
page.

Huge pages are guaranteed not to be special.
