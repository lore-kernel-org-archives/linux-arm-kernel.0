I guess the problem here is that people forget what a patch series is
actually doing and then start making comments based on hypothetical
stuff rather than what the series is actually doing.

To recap, this series:

1. Removes the wrong usage of BSYM() in the KVM code.  This is used with
   the symbol "panic" which is a function declared by generic C code.
   Therefore, panic will have the appropriate annotations attached to
   this symbol, unless GCC itself is buggy.

   This is the _only_ case of "ldr rd, =BSYM(sym)".

2. It replaces the remaining "adr rd, BSYM(sym)" with a new "badr" macro,
   and removes the BSYM() preprocessor macro.  The new "badr" macro which
   is identical in behaviour to the former, but ensures that BSYM()
   doesn't get mis-used with "ldr".
