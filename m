Oops (2)

Nico already mentioned that, and I failed to fix the commit log. I
added it at some point, but it wasn't really useful

There aren't that many. Anything that refers to absolute symbols will
break under CONFIG_RELOCATABLE and I haven't noticed any issues (I
tested extensively with Thumb2)

I don't mind open coded movw/movt for relative references in code that
is tightly coupled to a platform that guarantees v7+ so I didn't do a
full sweep. Also, I started with 50+ patches and tried to remove the
ones that are mostly orthogonal to the KASLR stuff.
