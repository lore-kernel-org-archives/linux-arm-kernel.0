I gave a quick try using your arm-kaslr-v3 branch, hopefully that's
the right one.

The good news is that now omap3 boots with omap2plus_defconfig with
and without CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE=y and I did not see any compiler
errors with my gcc 6.2.0 like earlier :)

I did see boot attempts fail with randomize enable where no output
was produced. It seems this is happening for me maybe 1 out of 5 boots.
Enabling DEBUG_LL did not show anything either.

Then loading modules with CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE=y seems to fail with:

$ sudo modprobe rtc-twl
rtc_twl: disagrees about version of symbol module_layout
modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'rtc_twl': Exec format error

Regards,

Tony
