 notification
Message-ID: <1520093380-42577-1-git-send-email-gengdongjiu@huawei.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

1. Detect whether KVM can set set guest SError syndrome
2. Support to Set VSESR_EL2 and inject SError by user space.
3. Support live migration to keep SError pending state and VSESR_EL2 value.
4. ACPI 6.1 adds support for NOTIFY_SEI as a GHES notification mechanism, so support this
   notification in software, KVM or kernel ARCH code call handle_guest_sei() to let ACP driver
   to handle this notification.

Dongjiu Geng (5):
  arm64: KVM: Prepare set virtual SEI syndrome value
  arm64: KVM: export the capability to set guest SError syndrome
  arm/arm64: KVM: Introduce set and get per-vcpu event
  ACPI / APEI: Add SEI notification type support for ARMv8
  arm64: handle NOTIFY_SEI notification by the APEI driver
