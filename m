I know, because I have reworked my patch lately to work on top of 4.3-rc
and Christoffer's timer rework series. I have something which "works
now"(TM), but wanted to wait for Christoffer's respin to send out.
I will send you this new version this as a sneak preview in private,
maybe that helps.

Cheers,
Andre.
