Subject: [PATCH 0/2] arm64: KVM: Fixes for 4.4-rc2
Message-ID: <1447669698-15939-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Here's a couple of fixes for KVM/arm64:

- The first one addresses a misinterpretation of the architecture
  spec, leading to the mishandling of I/O accesses generated from an
  AArch32 guest using banked registers.

- The second one is a workaround for a Cortex-A57 erratum.

Both patches are based on v4.4-rc1.
