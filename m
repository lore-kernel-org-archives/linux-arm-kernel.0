This code is so obviously broken that I completely overlooked it.

If we have take a doorbell interrupt, then it means nothing was
otherwise pending (because we'd have been kicked out of the blocking
state, and will have masked the doorbell). So checking for pending
interrupts is pointless.

Furthermore, calling kvm_vgic_vcpu_pending_irq() takes the ap_list
lock. If we take a doorbell interrupt while injecting a virtual
interrupt (from userspace, for example) on the same CPU, we end-up
in deadlock land. This would be solved by Christoffer's latest
crop of timer patches, but there is no point getting there the first
place.

The patchlet below solves it:

diff --git a/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-v4.c b/virt/kvm/arm/vgic/vgic-v4.c

 }

and I've queued it for the next round.

Thanks,
