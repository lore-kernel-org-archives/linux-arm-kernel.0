Since this is the first code that starts using our locking mechanism, we
add some (hopefully) clear documentation of our locking strategy and
requirements along with this patch.

we are not taking a lock here.  What are the locking expectations?  If
the expectarions are that the IRQ is locked when calling this function,
can we have a BIG FAT COMMENT saying that then?

It seems to me that we are somehow expecting irq->active and irq->vcpu
to be in sync, but that's not necessarily the case if the IRQ is not
locked.

I think this comment should be rewritten to:

If the IRQ is not active but enabled and pending, we should direct it to
its configured target VCPU.

not sure what idle means here, I suggest something like:

If neither active nor pending and enabled, then this IRQ should not be
queued to any VCPU.

is the default case there for making the compiler happy or can we just
get rid of it?

should we name this vgic_try_queue_irq_locked ?

should we have something like BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(irq->irq_lock));
here?

Not sure if there's some bug checking here which is only emitted if a
user select CONFIG_CHECK_SOME_LOCKING_THINGS that we could use...?

is the !vcpu check here not redundant because if you ever get to
evaluating it, then irq->vcpu is null, and pending and enabled are set,
which means the oracle couldn't have returned null, could it?

that would also explain why we don't have to re-check the same
conditions below...

or am I getting this wrong, because you could also have someone
explicitly setting the IRQ to active via trapped MMIO, in which case we
should be able to queue it without it being pending && enabled, which
would indicate that it's the other way around, you should only evaluate
!vcpu and kup the !(pending && enabled) part....?

here I'm concerned about the active state again.

I feel like something more similar to my initial version of this patch
is what we really want:

       if (irq->vcpu || vcpu != vgic_target_oracle(irq))
           goto real_retry;

and read_retry is then a label at the very top of this function, before
the initial call to vgic_target_oracle()....

I don't remember why we thought it was a good idea to have this BUG_ON()
anymore.  Anyone?

stray line here?  I don't understand this bit about 'must not be mapped'
and I think that should be moved to the explanation below with some
rationale, and if important, perhaps guarded with a BUG_ON() ?

We should probably write VGIC here instead of GIC, just to avoid
confusion.

Otherwise the split between update/queue looks reasonable here.

Btw., anywhere where I write 'you' in this mail, I mean 'we' and take
partial blame for any bugs here :)
