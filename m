Why?  I don't think it fits.  If there are any I/O areas (non-memory)
in the range then it simply is not "memory" and should not be using
memremap().  In other words it seems like you really do need to heed
the __iomem annotation in the return value from ioremap_uc().

I'm not going to do a general sweep for this as the expectation that
ioremap silently falls back if a mapping type is not supported is
buried all over the place.  That said, new usages and conversions to
memremap() can be strict about this. For now, I'm only handling
ioremap_cache() and ioremap_wt() conversions.

Yes, in the next rev of this series I am having it fall back to direct
mappings where it makes sense.

memremap() explicitly does not want get into arch semantics debates.
The pointer returned from memremap() is a "void *" that can be used as
normal memory.  If it is a normal pointer I don't see the role for
sparse annotation.

What requirements beyond PAGE_SIZE alignment would we need to worry about?
