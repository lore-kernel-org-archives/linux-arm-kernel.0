This patch is used both by patch 19 and by patch 20, which I preferred
not to merge with each other: ptrace and prctl are significantly
different things.

The prctl bit definitions are added here because they are the canonical
definitions used by both interfaces.  The ptrace #defines are based on
them.

Does it make sense if I merge patch 20 into this one and apply patch 19
on top?  This avoide the appearance of prctl #defines with no prctl
implementation.

Cheers
