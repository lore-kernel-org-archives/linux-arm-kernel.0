Ok, this is true for anon pages. But, if we really need to do the D/I
flush for user mapped page cache pages in flush_dcache_page() then it
should also be done by flush_kernel_dcache_page().  In general, both
flush_dcache_page() and flush_kernel_dcache_page() need to handle the
case in which the kernel modifies such a page. (This means that in
effect, both functions should be the same in the arm64 case.)

Yes, but how do we know?
