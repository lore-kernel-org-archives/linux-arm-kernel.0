Subject: [RFC PATCH 2/8] thread_info: allow custom in-task thread_info
In-Reply-To: <1473947349-14521-1-git-send-email-mark.rutland@arm.com>

Currently, task_struct is defined in <linux/sched.h>, which (indirectly)
pulls in a number of low-level arch headers such as <asm/preempt.h>
through a number of other headers. Thus, code and structures in these
headers can't rely on the definition of task_struct. Some of these
headers are necessary for the definition of task_struct, so moving
task_struct into its own header is insufficient tio avoid circular
includes.

With CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, arch code needs to implement its own
get_current() for the generic get_thread_info(). To avoid header
dependency issues, this relies on thread_info being the first member of
task_struct. This can be used by low-level arch code, as it doesn't
depend on the definition of task_struct.

For architectures without preempt-safe this_cpu ops, some data required
by low-level arch code (e.g. preempt_count) has to be stored per-thread,
and for the reasons above, we cannot place this in task_struct (or
thread_struct, since we cannot know its offset from within task_struct).
The only practical location for these is thread_info.

This patch allows architectures with CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_OWN_THREAD_INFO to
define their own thread_info, avoiding the problems described above.
