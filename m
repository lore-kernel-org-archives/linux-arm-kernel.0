That's a restriction due on the initial memory map. At some point we may
add support in head.S to parse the dtb and extract the size information.
Not critical at this stage.

Otherwise the kernel cannot access the generic timer registers (it is
described in the AArch64 exception model which isn't public yet).

What do you mean by AMP?

If you only want to use 3 CPUs out of 4 for example, you change the FDT
information that gets passed to the kernel accordingly. So the kernel
wouldn't touch the 4th one.
