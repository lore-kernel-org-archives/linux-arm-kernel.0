Not currently, no. The plugins are built with the host compiler before
the target compiler is invoked, and asm-offsets is built with the
target compiler.

Kees: any ideas on how to resolve this?

That is a bit tricky, unfortunately: building head-inflate-data.c with
the stack protector disabled is easy, but we'll also need to build
zlib_inflate() in the same way.

Sure. I will put the right hand sides in a shared header as #defines
and use those in the plugin source.
