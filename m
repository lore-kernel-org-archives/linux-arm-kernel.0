Yeah, in the ARM case, that's true. I think we should probably keep it
marked "correctly" though.

Yeah, this will likely be a future improvement. Some architectures
already mark .rodata before the mark_rodata_ro() call. Once we start
to have more use of postinit-readonly, I suspect we'll see more
clarification of when those things happen.
