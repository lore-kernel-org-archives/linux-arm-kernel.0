I consider breaking buggy drivers (in a way that they either generally
work okay or that they break with a nice OOPS depending on config) to
be better than having a special case in what's supposed to be a fast
path to keep them working.  I did consider forcing the relevant debug
options on for a while just to help shake these bugs out the woodwork
faster.

By "leak" I mean that a bug or exploit causes unintended code to run
with CR0.WP or a special CR3 or a special PTE or whatever loaded.  PaX
hooks the entry code to avoid leaks.

Makes it harder to exploit a case where the CR3 setting leaks.

Can you clarify these uses that extend beyond vmlinux?  I haven't
looked at the grsecurity patch extensively.  Are you talking about the
BPF JIT stuff?  If so, I think that should possibly be handled a bit
differently, since I think the normal
write-to-rare-write-vmlinux-sections primitive should preferably *not*
be usable to write to executable pages.  Using a real mm_struct for
this could help.

Indeed.

If I use the primitive to try to write a value to the wrong section
(write to kernel text, for example), IMO it would be nice to OOPS
instead of succeeding.

Please keep in mind that, unlike PaX, uses of a pax_open_kernel()-like
function will may be carefully audited by a friendly security expert
such as yourself.  It would be nice to harden the primitive to a
reasonable extent against minor misuses such as putting it in a
context where the compiler will emit mov-a-reg-with-WP-set-to-CR0;
ret.
