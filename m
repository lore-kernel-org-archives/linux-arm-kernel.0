Oh, you can imagine that I put my best Dr. Evil hat on this week and
have my finger on the button already. In fact if I have my way future
SBSA compliant systems will be required to use an IOMMU with no way to
avoid having one. Whether that was before or after I was reduced to
walking kernel memory one word at a time and using pen and paper to
derive the above...We've a couple of years of "robustness investment"
ahead on ARM servers to ensure that we catch all of these things. And we
will catch all of them. And it will be utterly perfect.

Jon.
