Subject: [PATH V2 0/6] RCU get_user_pages_fast and __get_user_pages_fast

Hello,
This series implements general forms of get_user_pages_fast and
__get_user_pages_fast and activates them for arm and arm64.

These are required for Transparent HugePages to function correctly, as
a futex on a THP tail will otherwise result in an infinite loop (due to
the core implementation of __get_user_pages_fast always returning 0).

Unfortunately, a futex on THP tail can be quite common for certain
workloads; thus THP is unreliable without a __get_user_pages_fast
implementation.

This series may also be beneficial for direct-IO heavy workloads and
certain KVM workloads.

Changes since PATCH V1 are:
 * Rebase to 3.17-rc1
 * Switched to kick_all_cpus_sync as suggested by Mark Rutland.

The main changes since RFC V5 are:
 * Rebased against 3.16-rc1.
 * pmd_present no longer tested for by gup_huge_pmd and gup_huge_pud,
   because the entry must be present for these leaf functions to be
   called. 
 * Rather than assume puds can be re-cast as pmds, a separate
   function pud_write is instead used by the core gup.
 * ARM activation logic changed, now it will only activate
   RCU_TABLE_FREE and RCU_GUP when running with LPAE.

The main changes since RFC V4 are:
 * corrected the arm64 logic so it now correctly rcu-frees page
   table backing pages.
 * rcu free logic relaxed for pre-ARMv7 ARM as we need an IPI to
   invalidate TLBs anyway.
 * rebased to 3.15-rc3 (some minor changes were needed to allow it to merge).
 * dropped Catalin's mmu_gather patch as that's been merged already.

This series has been tested with LTP mm tests and some custom futex tests
that exacerbate the futex on THP tail case; on both an Arndale board and
a Juno board. Also debug counters were temporarily employed to ensure that
the RCU_TABLE_FREE logic was behaving as expected.

I would really appreciate any comments (especially on the validity or
otherwise of the core fast_gup implementation) and testers.

Cheers,
