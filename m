Subject: [PATCH 1/2] arm: KVM: Do not update PC if the trap handler has
 updated it

Assuming we trap a coprocessor access, and decide that the access
is illegal, we will inject an exception in the guest. In this
case, we shouldn't increment the PC, or the vcpu will miss the
first instruction of the handler, leading to a mildly confused
guest.

Solve this by snapshoting PC before the access is performed,
and checking if it has moved or not before incrementing it.
