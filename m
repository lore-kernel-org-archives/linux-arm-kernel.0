Only if the guest actually touches FPSIMD state.  If the guest doesn't
touch FPSIMD (no trap to EL2), then we never touch the state at all.

I don't understand what the redundant part here is?  Isn't it only
redundant in the case where the host (for some reason) has already saved
its FPSIMD state?  I assume that won't be the common case, since
"userspace->kernel->kvm_run" won't save the FPSIMD state, as you just
explained above.

Again, I'm confused, because to me it looks like
kvm_fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() boils down to fpsimd_flush_cpu_state()
which just sets a pointer to NULL, but doesn't actually save the state.

So, when is the state in the hardware registers saved to memory?

I agree with the approach, I guess I just can't seem to follow the code
correctly...

I think that would invert the logic we have now, so instead of only
saving/restoring the FPSIMD state when the guest uses it (as we do now),
we would only save/restore the FPSIMD state when the host uses it,
regardless of what the guest does.

Ideally, we could have a combination of both, but it's unclear to me if
we have good indications that one case is more likely than the other.

My gut feeling though, is that the guest will be likely to often access
FPSIMD state for as long as we're in KVM_RUN, and that host userspace
also often uses FPSIMD (memcopy, etc.), but the rest of the host kernel
(kernel threads etc.) is unlikely to use FPSIMD for a system that is
primarily running VMs.

vhost is the offload mechanism for the data-path of virtio devices, and
for example if you have an application in your VM which is sending data,
the VM will typically fill some buffer and then cause a trap to the host
kernel by writing to an emulated PCI MMIO register, and that trap is
handled by KVM's IO bus infrastructure, which schedules a vhost kernel
thread which actually sends the data from the buffer shared between the
VM and the host kernel onto the physical network.
