Subject: [PATCH v5] KVM: arm/arm64: Route vtimer events to user space
Message-ID: <1474548769-195643-1-git-send-email-agraf@suse.de>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

We have 2 modes for dealing with interrupts in the ARM world. We can either
handle them all using hardware acceleration through the vgic or we can emulate
a gic in user space and only drive CPU IRQ pins from there.

Unfortunately, when driving IRQs from user space, we never tell user space
about timer events that may result in interrupt line state changes, so we
lose out on timer events if we run with user space gic emulation.

This patch fixes that by syncing user space's view of the vtimer irq line
with the kvm view of that same line.

With this patch I can successfully run edk2 and Linux with user space gic
emulation.

v1 -> v2:

  - Add back curly brace that got lost

v2 -> v3:

  - Split into patch set

v3 -> v4:

  - Improve documentation

v4 -> v5:

  - Rewrite to use pending state sync in sregs (marc)
  - Remove redundant checks of vgic_initialized()
  - qemu tree to try this out: https://github.com/agraf/u-boot.git no-kvm-irqchip-for-v5

 capability via KVM_ENABLE_CAP ioctl on the vcpu fd. Note that this
 will disable the use of APIC hardware virtualization even if supported
 by the CPU, as it's incompatible with SynIC auto-EOI behavior.
+
+8.3 KVM_CAP_ARM_TIMER
+
+Architectures: arm, arm64
+This capability, if KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION indicates that it is available and no
+in-kernel interrupt controller is in use, means that that the kernel populates
+the vcpu's run->s.regs.kernel_timer_pending field with timers that are currently
+considered pending by kvm.
+
+If active, it also allows user space to propagate its own pending state of timer
+interrupt lines using run->s.regs.user_timer_pending. If those two fields
+mismatch during CPU execution, kvm will exit to user space to give it a chance
+to update its own interrupt pending status. This usually involves triggering
+an interrupt line on a user space emulated interrupt controller.
+
+The fields run->s.regs.kernel_timer_pending and run->s.regs.user_timer_pending
+are available independent of run->kvm_valid_regs or run->kvm_dirty_regs bits.
+If no in-kernel interrupt controller is used and the capability exists, they
+will always be available and used.
+
+Currently the following bits are defined for both bitmaps:
+
+    KVM_ARM_TIMER_VTIMER  -  virtual timer
+
+Future versions of kvm may implement additional timer events. These will get
+indicated by additional KVM_CAP extensions.
