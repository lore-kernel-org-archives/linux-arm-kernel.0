So while things are steadily improving, there is still more things to do
(and the more I review the code, the more I find things, which worries me).

The biggest issue at the moment is the handling of accesses at EL0,
which should be forwarded to EL1 instead of ignoring the access when
denied. There is also the UNDEFINED accesses (which are pretty easy to
solve), and a couple of straightforward bugs and other nits that should
be easy to fix.

If you can fix the above and that the result looks good, I'll try to put
it into -next. But at the moment, it looks like we're not really on
track to make it into 4.5.

Thanks,
