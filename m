The goal is to put as much sensitive stuff from .data as possible into
.rodata, which is mostly structures with function pointers, etc. I
haven't measured the "final" results, since there's still a lot of
work to do to get all the other annotations into upstream.

AIUI, we're just flipping toe domain from DOMAIN_KERNEL to
DOMAIN_WR_RARE on the .rodata section (which is already 1MB aligned),
and (in the future if I or someone else can figure out how) on the
kernel module vmap area (which also shouldn't be changing alignment at
all).
