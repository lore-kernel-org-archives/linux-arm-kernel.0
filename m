That ignored and blocked behavior is a very weird implementation,
but for a synchronous signal it amounts to enforcing coredump and
then exit behavior.  As the process does not continue past that
point the behavior is not observable by userspace.

I am only suggesting that all synchronous signals, aka signals where
it helps to point at the instruction from the signal information
get that treatment.  As the vast majority are synchronous I was
asking about this one oddball case.

I looked it up yesterday to be clear, and POSIX actually says the
behavior is implemenation dependent/undefined if you try to ignore
SIGFPE.

asynchronous.

The commit looks like it was a case of the code not looking right
and you just switching to send_sig_info.

force_sig_info really out to be called something like synchronous_sig.

I am looking at sorting that out as part of cleaning up the signal
handling.  There is currently a small bug where under the right
circumstances these synchronous signals might be improperly delivered
after a thread specific signal.  To make that very unlikely there is a
special case in dequeue_signal for synchronous signals but it is
imperfect and slower than necessary.

The function really ought to look something like:

void synch_sig(struct siginfo *info)
{
	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
        int sig = info->si_signo;
        struct ksignal ksig;
	struct k_sigaction *ka;
        bool blocked, ignored;
        unsigned long flags;

        WARN_ON(!siginmask(sig, SYNCHRONOUS_MASK));

	copy_siginfo(info, &ksig.info);
	spin_lock_irqsave(&tsk->sighand->siglock, flags);
	ka = &tsk->sighand->action[sig - 1];
	ignored = ka->sa.sa_handler == SIG_IGN;
	blocked = sigismember(&tsk->blocked, sig);
	ksig.ka = *ka;
	if (blocked || ignored) {
		ksig.ka.sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
	} else if (ka->sa.sa_flags & SA_ONESHOT) {
		ka->sa.sa_handler = SIG_DFL;
	}
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&tsk->sighand->siglock, flags);

	if (ksig.ka.sa.sa_handler == SIG_DFL) {
		do_coredump(&ksig->info);
		do_group_exit(sig);
		/* NOTREACHED */
	}

	handle_signal(&ksig, signal_pt_regs());
}

Which is both clearer and faster and less buggy than the current
implementation as it delivers the signal immediately with no chance
of the signal queue to reorder things.

But it is going to take a little bit to get there as there are a number
of implementations of handle_signal like the ones on arm and arm64 that
perform needed register adjustments outside of handle_signal.
