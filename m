This should be "before guest entry", because the timer might have 
expired in between.

Yup. It seems to work. It also does feel slower than the previous code, 
but maybe that's just me. It definitely is way more correct.

I'll trace around a bit more to see whether I can spot any obviously low 
hanging performance fruits, then prettify the patches and send them out :).
