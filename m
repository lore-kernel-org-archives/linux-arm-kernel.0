This is a tricky one.  I think that in general, if the guest
misconfigures the level/edge of a virtual interrupt, it is only setting
itself up for trouble, which doesn't interfere with the host
functionality, so we don't have to worry about that.  What we do have to
worry is about is that the guest can't interfere with the host in
uninteded ways by playing with the interrupts.  Let's consider the two
scenarios:

Phys = level, Virt = Edge
-------------------------
These patches don't change anything from today's behavior.  We may loose
interrupts for the VM, tough.

Phys = edge, Virt = Level
-------------------------
In this case we will read the physical input level on return from the
VM.  That changes the virtual line_level, no harm done.  If we see the
input line to the VGIC (or physial pending state) is asserted, we will
deactivate a physical interrup which means, if it's actually pending,
the driver (VFIO or arch timer, typically) will take another
interrupt, no harm done.

So I think we're fine.
