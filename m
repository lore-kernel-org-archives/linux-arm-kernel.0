The GICv3 explicit does not do the same as the ITS init.
GICv3 init does not map the resources (KVM iodevice registration). This
is done at 1st VCPU run.
ITS init does map the resources. If we call the ITS init at the same
place as we call the GICv3 init, in the realization function, the region
mapping is not yet done so you will map resources at undefined location.

I am definitively not opposed to call the ITS init function explicitly
from user side but this must happen after the KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR. So
another machine_init_done function must be registered and the notifier
must be called AFTER the notifier that calls the KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR
ioctl. However you cannot easily master the machine init done notifier
registration order because in target-arm/kvm.c there is a single
notifier that calls all the KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR for all the KVM devices
(kvm_arm_machine_init_done). So it is not possible to register the ITS
init notifier before the "kvm_arm_set_device_addr" notifier.

So my understanding is one must do things outside of the existing framework?

Hope this clarifies

Thanks

Eric
