Correct me if I am wrong, I think this would make "get_alt_insn" generate branch
instructions based on the  aliased linear mapped address, which could branch to linear
address of the branch target which doesn't have Execute permissions set.
I think we sould use ALT_ORIG_PTR(alt), instead of origptr for the calls to
get_alt_insn().
