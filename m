The annotation in the commit message was quite nice.

Right, ok, it just slightly ticked my OCD to have a separate notion of a
tag and a region, and then merge them in a variabled named 'tag_val'.
But with the comment above, I think I can still manage to sleep at
night.

It feels a bit like defensive coding, which we don't normally do, so I
was confused if this was something we actually expected to encounter in
some cases, or if we were just covering out backs.  If it's the latter,
then it makes perfect sense to me, and I'd rather catch an error here
than see the world explode later.
