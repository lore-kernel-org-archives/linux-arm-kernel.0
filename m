Without understanding the details of the GIC, but I have to agree that
a failure without error where the guest is hung is one of the worst
cases - when a user comes to you saying that their VM hangs after
migration with no diagnostics, then you know you're in for some nasty
debug!

On other architectures we definitely provide this level of compatibility
between kernels, libraries, qemu and everything in between - it's not
easy, and we do screwup from time to time; but it's still what we try
and get right.

So ideally you'd make this switchable and wire it into a versioned
machine type in QEMU, so that only virt-3.0 VMs would use this (and
they'd somehow know they needed the new kernel to do it).

If that's not possible then you could add a subsection to the GIC migration
data if you can detect at migration time that this feature is being
used, and make the destination check for the feature/kernel.
Migrating to an older qemu would fail since it wouldn't know about the
new subsection.  This should at least get a clear failure.

For a user, this still gets messy if they do something like start
upgrading some of the hosts in an openstack cluster, which they often
do incrementally; so you'll suddenly get the situation of a VM that
was started on a host with a newer kernel being migrated to an older one
and stuff breaks.
