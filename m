Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm64: Increase number of memslots to 512
Message-ID: <1484153537-20984-1-git-send-email-linucherian@gmail.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Linu Cherian <linu.cherian@cavium.com>

Having only 32 memslots is a real constraint for the maximum number of
PCI devices that can be assigned to a single guest. Assuming each PCI
device/virtual function having two memory BAR regions, we could assign
only 15 devices/virtual functions to a guest.

So increase KVM_MEM_SLOTS_NUM to 512 as done in other archs like x86 and
powerpc. For this, KVM_USER_MEM_SLOTS has been changed to 508.
