VHE also adds an extra virtual timer, for symmetry with what EL1
provides (and on which CNTVOFF doesn't have any effect) - see section
B8.1.1 of the ARMv8.1 addendum. So we effectively have:

- Secure physical EL3
- Non-secure physical EL1
- Non-secure virtual EL1
- Non-secure physical EL2
- Non-secure virtual EL2

Thanks,
