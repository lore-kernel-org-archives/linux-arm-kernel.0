Which patches are you looking at? The current code in mainline looks
like this:

	vtimer = vcpu_vtimer(vcpu);

	vtimer->cnt_ctl = read_sysreg_el0(cntv_ctl);
	if (kvm_timer_irq_can_fire(vtimer))
		kvm_timer_update_irq(vcpu, true, vtimer);

I'd suggest you use mainline and report if this doesn't work.

Thanks,

	M.
