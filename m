Basically yes.

ID_HIDDEN() means we are bodging around something that we don't know
how to sanitise, whereas ID_UNALLOCATED() means that we follow the
architecture in returning zero for reads (maybe following an older
architecture version than the silicon).  

ID_HIDDEN()s may need to evolve SoC-specific quirkage if we need to
expose non-architectural SoC-specific features via the mechanism.
These should never simply be exposed unless the architecture is
tightened in the future in such a way as to make this safe (unlikely).

ID_UNALLOCATED()s OTOH will mostly turn into ID_SANITISED() as the
architecture gains new features.  The architecture could allocate new
IMP DEF feature regs though, in which case they would become ID_HIDDEN()
as soon as we know about them.


The distinction is drawn in attempt to help maintainers: the future
maintenance requirements for IN_UNALLOCATED()s will differ from
ID_HIDDEN()s.
