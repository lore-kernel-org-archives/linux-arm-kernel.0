64-bit writes are /usually/ atomic but alignment or compiler emiting 32-bit opcodes could also do it. I agree there are a few other pieces to this we will chat about separately and come back to this thread. Time for some zzzz...long weekend!

That's worrying but I can tell you offline why ;).

Anyway, 64-bit writes are atomic on ARMv8, so you shouldn't see half
updates. To make sure the compiler does not generate something weird,
change the set_(pte|pmd|pud) to use an inline assembly with a 64-bit
STR.

One question - is the PMD a table or a block? You mentioned set_pte_at
at some point, which leads me to think it's a (transparent) huge page,
hence block mapping.

Even if you don't have that barrier, the worst that can happen is that
you get another trap back in the kernel (from user; translation fault)
but the page table read by the kernel is valid and normally the
instruction restarted.

It could be hiding some other problems.
