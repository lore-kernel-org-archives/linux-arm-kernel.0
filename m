Hi Andre,

I've given this some more thoughts, and one thing really worries me. Up
to now, we've only filled the vcpu->run structure when we were about to
give it to userspace, and would never use it ourselves.

Now, we seem to be using much more extensively at various points in the
code. What if userspace changes it under our feet? What guarantee do we
have that this is always safe?

That makes me feel very uncomfortable. I'd rather see an intermediate
structure being used to pass the parameters around, and only fill run at
the last moment. I'd probably sleep better... ;-)

Thanks,

	M.
