This is going to break existing user space binaries at some point. Some 
applications pretty much always assumed 3g space and are likely to fail 
otherwise. The 2g/2g config is good for people wanting to dispense with 
highmem and the ability to test their user space with it before 
deployment.

Also, this is a lot of complexity added to the kernel for a very 
negligible security gain. It is trivial from user space to determine 
what the actual PAGE_OFFSET is, so that won't be a serious deterrent.

Please capture all this somewhere. Either in the commit log, or in the 
Booting document, or both.
