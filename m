The reason why I used gettimeofday.c as a filename is because it is the naming
convention that I could see more often in the kernel and I feel that, if we have
even the implementations of gettimeofday(), time() and clock_getres() in the
same file is probably the most representative.

I agree, and in the long term would be my preferred approach as well, but I
would prefer to keep this "optimization" in a separate patchset for what I
mentioned in my previous email.

Yes, I agree it would be great to have have the other architectures to join the
effort because I believe that the whole ecosystem would benefit from it.
