So again, I was more asking for a new commit message for the next
version of the patch rather than an explanation here.  But I the commit
message should not mention assumptions about how EL3 firmware works, but
try to stay within the semantics laid out by the ARM architecture.

For example:

  ARMv8.2 introduces two new bits, TEA and TERR, which [...].  When RAS
  is available, we set these bits on the HCR_EL2, because we want to
  take external aborts to EL2 in order for [...].



Thanks,
