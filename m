Subject: [PATCH v2] KVM: arm/arm64: Check memslot bounds before mapping
 hugepages
Message-ID: <20180926151135.16083-1-koomi@moshbit.net>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Userspace can create a memslot with memory backed by (transparent)
hugepages, but with bounds that do not align with hugepages.
In that case, we cannot map the entire region in the guest as hugepages
without exposing additional host memory to the guest and potentially
interfering with other memslots.
Consequently, this patch adds a bounds check when populating guest page
tables and forces the creation of regular PTEs if mapping an entire
hugepage would violate the memslots bounds.

Hi everyone,

for v2, in addition to writing the condition the way Marc suggested, I
moved the whole check so it also catches the problem when the hugepage
was allocated explicitly, not only for THPs. The second line is quite
long, but splitting it up would make things rather ugly IMO, so I left
it as it is.

Regards,
Lukas
