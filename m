Indeed I found a similar comment in some older revisions of the code.

But isn't it that other code holding the lock (thinking about
kvm_vgic_flush_hwstate() in particular) assumes that no-one else tinkers
with the VGIC state while it holds the lock?
So couldn't we (potentially) run into inconsistent state because we
cleared the queued bit while the flushing code runs over all interrupts?
Maybe not in this particular case, but in general?

Haven't looked at your new series yet, but will do this ASAP.

Cheers,
Andre.
