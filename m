Yes, I agree with you, POU instructions are NOPs if the caches are transparent.
There was no issue as per correctness point of view. But causing the unnecessary
overhead in ASM routines where code goes thorough VA range incremented
by cache line size. This overhead is noticeable with 64K PAGE, especially with 
sections mappings. I'll reword the commit text to reflect your comments in v2 patch.

e.g. 512M section with 64K PAGE_SIZE kernel, assume 64Bytes cache size.
     flush_icache_range() consumes around 256M cpu cycles
 
Icache loop overhead: 512Mbytes / 64Bytes * 4 instructions per loop
Dcache loop overhead: 512Mbytes / 64Bytes * 4 instructions per loop


With this patch it takes less than ~1K cycles.

Alternative framework might break things in case of CPU hotplug. I need one
more confirmation from you on incorporating alternative framework.
