In principle, yes. But currently, the code is not entirely XIP clean,
i.e., the kaslr_offset and __efi_boot variables are in .text but
assumed to be writable.

For UEFI, this does not really matter, because that implies !XIP.
However, I agree it would be nice if ZBOOT_ROM could run this code as
well, but it requires a global variable. I will try to make that work.
