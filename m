Subject: [PATCH v2] arm64: dts: rockchip: add "rockchip,
 grf" property for RK3399 PMUCRU/CRU
Message-ID: <1483945344-3125-1-git-send-email-zhengxing@rock-chips.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The structure rockchip_clk_provider needs to refer the GRF regmap
in somewhere, if the CRU node has not "rockchip,grf" property,
calling syscon_regmap_lookup_by_phandle will return an invalid GRF
regmap, and the MUXGRF type clock will be not supported.

Therefore, we need to add them.

- referring pmugrf for PMUGRU
- fix the typo "invaild" in COMMIT message
