Indeed, I will change that.

Yes, that is interesting. We should also think about how to handle
'nokaslr' if it appears on the command line, since in the !EFI case,
we will be way too late to parse this, and a capable kernel will
already be running from a randomized offset. That means it is the
bootloader's responsibility to ensure that the presence of 'nokaslr'
and the entropy in x1 are consistent with each other.

Yep. I hate TEXT_OFFSET, did I mention that?
