That sounds logically sensible, but to be clear, this would be a
semantic change to this function, right?

(i.e., it forces skipping of the GICv3 handling code in a case where
it previously wasn't forced -- at least not within this function.  The
arguments about whether vgic_v2_cpuif_trap and vgic_v3_cpuif_trap can
ever be true simultaneously still apply.)
