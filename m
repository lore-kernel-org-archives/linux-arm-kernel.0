I've asked the people with the right knowledge about the correct API to use (Hi Catalin!),
and during the review it did not throw any red flags. I guess, given Bjorn's comment,
that everyone assumed AArch64 is the same as all other architectures and pgprot_device
is synonymous to pgprot_noncached.

I'm not aware of issues being reported, but Lorenzo might have more info on this.

That was the initial intention, to let arches / platforms overwrite the whole
pci_remap_iospace(). I guess the reality is that no one needs to overwrite it except
for the AArch64 quirk, so probably easier to remove the __weak and fix the attributes for arm64.
