I see your point, but I think there are serious issues with the current
approach as well:

- a lot of the less common architectures just don't get updated
  in time, out of 22 architectures that don't use asm-generic/unistd.h,
  only 12 have pwritev2 in linux-next, and only three have pkey_mprotect

- some architectures that add all syscalls sometimes make a mistake
  and forget one, e.g. alpha apparently never added __NR_bpf, but it
  did add the later __NR_execveat.

- when glibc updates their minimum supported kernel version, they
  would like to drop obsolete syscalls, but when each architecture
  adds the calls at a different time, it's hard to tell when a
  replacement syscall is guaranteed to be available

- linux-next produces warnings about missing syscalls on most
  architectures half of the time since it's impossible for an
  arch maintainer to hook up the number before the implementation
  is merged 

Regarding the review process, I'd really hope we've improved enough
that we can rely on the review on linux-arch/linux-api to catch
all serious issues like system call that cannot be defined the same
way on all architectures. If we fail at this, there is a more
serious issue with the review process.

Since all syscalls now go through SYSCALL_DEFINEx(), we have
covered the hardest part (sign/zero extending short arguments),
and a lot more people are aware of problems with struct alignment
since it differs between i386 and x86_64 and also affects all
ioctl interfaces. I think the last time a syscall made it in that
didn't just work on all architectures was sync_file_range, and
that was nine years ago.

Got it, I missed the fact that we support native OABI kernels.

If we hit this case, why not just use the wrapper on both EABI
and OABI for simplicity? It's not like we care a lot about
micro-optimizing OABI any more.

Ok. After rebasing my randconfig tree on today's linux-next, I needed
this hunk to avoid a warning:

Agreed, I saw the same thing there.

That brings up an interesting issue: it would be nice to use the
same input file for arch/arm/ and the compat mode of arch/arm64,
like x86 does. If we handle both oabi and arm64-compat in the same
file, we end up with a superset of what x86 does, and we could
use a single script again, and generate all four tables for
ARM (native OABI, OABI-on-EABI, native EABI, EABI-on-arm64).

Another related case in asm-generic, which defines three tables:
native 32-bit, native 64-bit and compat 32-bit. This one not only
needs to have three different function pointers (e.g. sys_fcntl64,
sys_fcntl and compat_sys_fcntl64) but also different macros (e.g.
__NR_fcntl64 and __NR_fcntl).

Anything wrong with this approach:?

/* ARM */
221  oabi  fcntl64                 sys_fcntl64             sys_oabi_fcntl64
221  eabi  fcntl64                 sys_fcntl64             compat_sys_fcntl64

/* asm-generic */
25   32    fcntl64                 sys_fcntl64             compat_sys_fcntl64
25   64    fcntl                   sys_fcntl

syscallnr.sh isn't used on x86, and probably won't be needed on
most (or all) others, right? 

Generally speaking I'd think that having a check for the ${ARCH}
variable and doing this conditionally in that one script is fine
here, if we need other architecture specific versions, they we can
use case/esac.

Similar checks exist in scripts/recordmcount.pl,
scripts/package/builddeb, scripts/tags.sh etc.
