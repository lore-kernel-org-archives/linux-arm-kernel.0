Sure, that's the behaviour today in effect.

I'll leave the documentation unchanged, then we can take advantage of
this flexibility later if is proves to be useful.

Currently the set of places where the "TIF_SVE implies sve_state valid"
assumption is applied is not very constrained, so while your suggestion
is reasonable I'd rather not mess with it just now, if possible.


But we can do this (which is what my current fixup has):

el0_sve_acc:
	enable_dbg_and_irq
	// ...
	bl	do_sve_acc
	b	ret_to_user

void do_sve_acc(unsigned int esr, struct pt_regs *regs)
{
	/* Even if we chose not to use SVE, the hardware could still trap: */
	if (unlikely(!system_supports_sve()) || WARN_ON(is_compat_task())) {
		force_signal_inject(SIGILL, ILL_ILLOPC, regs, 0);
		return;
	}

	sve_alloc(current);

	local_bh_disable();
	if (test_and_clear_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) {
		task_fpsimd_load(); /* flushes high Zn bits as a side-effect */
		sve_flush_pregs();
	} else {
		sve_flush_all(); /* flush all the SVE bits in-place */
	}

	if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE))
		WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */
	local_bh_enable();
}

where sve_flush_all() zeroes all the high Zn bits via a series of
MOV Vn, Vn instructions, and also zeroes Pn and FFR.  sve_fplush_pregs()
just does the latter.

In the common case the sve_alloc() does a memzero, but doesn't
allocate memory because more often than not, it will already have
been allocated.

On this path, the memzero is now pointless -- I'll need to double-check
what else may be impacted by its removal (probably only ptrace, and I'm
not sure if the zeroing is strictly required there).


There is still a bit of room for improvement, but it's still a step up
from v2.

What do you think?
