I was thinking park as in parking disk heads, i.e., get things so we can
kick FPSIMD without doing damage.

(Or indeed, applying the handbrake so your car doesn't roll away
downhill while you're gone.)

But of a strained analogy though, I'll admit.

To me, "hw" carries too much of a suggestion that we would be flushing
the registers back to memory.  In fact, we don't touch the hardware
here, only kernel bookkeeping data.

Trying to come up with an intuitive name for this may be futile; how
about

 * _sync_ (which is suitably vague), or
 * _ctxsync_ (which will avoid fooling people into thinking they know
	what it does without looking at the code)

?

I expect so.  I added these as bools partly for simplicity and partly
because there was no general-purpose flags field already.

We could make debug_flags into a general-purpose flags field, though.

Once we've agreed about the park_fp renaming, I'll consider reworking
this also -- but I'll punt it to a separate patch if it turns out to be
non-trivial.
