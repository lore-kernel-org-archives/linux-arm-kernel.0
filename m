Subject: [PATCH v3 00/32] PCI: fix config and I/O Address space memory mappings
Message-ID: <20170411122923.6285-1-lorenzo.pieralisi@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patch series[1] is a v3 of a previous version:

v2: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/3/27/220

v2 -> v3:
	- Created a default ioremap_nopost() implementation in a separate
	  asm-generic header and patched all arches to make use of it
	- Removed PCI drivers patches from the series to simplify the
	  review, they will be posted separately once the ioremap_nopost()
	  interface is settled
	- Fixed devm_ioremap_* BUS offset comments and implemented
	  nopost interface on top of it
	- Added collected tags

v1: https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/2/27/228

v1 -> v2:
	- Changed pci_remap_cfgspace() to more generic ioremap_nopost()
	  interface
	- Added pgprot_nonposted
	- Fixed build errors on arches not relying on asm-generic headers
	- Added PCI versatile host controller driver patch
	- Added missing config space remapping to hisilicon host controller

---------------------
Original cover letter
---------------------

PCI local bus specifications (Rev3.0, 3.2.5 "Transaction Ordering
and Posting") strictly require PCI configuration and I/O Address space
write transactions to be non-posted.

Current crop of DT/ACPI PCI host controllers drivers relies on
the ioremap interface to map ECAM and ECAM-derivative PCI config
regions and pci_remap_iospace() to create a VMA for mapping
PCI host bridge I/O Address space transactions to CPU virtual address
space.

On some platforms (ie ARM/ARM64) ioremap fails to comply with the PCI
configuration non-posted write transactions requirement, because it
provides a memory mapping that issues "bufferable" or, in PCI terms
"posted" write transactions. Likewise, the current pci_remap_iospace()
implementation maps the physical address range that the PCI translates
to I/O space cycles to virtual address space through pgprot_device()
attributes that on eg ARM64 provides a memory mapping issuing
posted writes transactions, which is not PCI specifications compliant.

This patch series[1] addresses both issues in one go:

- It updates the pci_remap_iospace() function to use a page mapping
  that guarantees non-posted write transactions for I/O space addresses
- It adds a kernel API to remap PCI config space resources, so that
  architecture can override it with a mapping implementation that
  guarantees PCI specifications compliancy wrt non-posted write
  configuration transactions
- It updates all PCI host controller implementations (and the generic
  ECAM layer) to use the newly introduced mapping interface

Tested on Juno ECAM based interface (DT/ACPI).

Non-ECAM PCI host controller drivers patches need checking to make
sure that:

- I patched the correct resource region mapping for config space
- There are not any other ways to ensure posted-write completion
  in the respective pci_ops that make the relevant patch unnecessary
