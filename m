ok, I was trying to keep it in same way as DT, where of_dma_configure
(here acpi_dma_configure) calls of_iommu_configure(here iort_iommu_configure)
which ends up doing the check. So will have to be changed in both places
for symmetry.

In case of other errors apart from EPROBE_DEFER,
iommu = NULL should be set, before passing it on to
arch_setup_dma_ops.
