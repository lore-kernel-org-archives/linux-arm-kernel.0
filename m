I really don't like the duplication of the #defines, just because tbnz
takes a bit number rather than a mask. I think for now we should follow
the status quo and use the immediate with a comment (we already do this
with PSR_I_BIT), but perhaps as a followup we should adjust the UAPI
headers to generate the PSR masks using shifts instead?

Not taken a proper look at the series yet, but this jumped out at me :)
