This should only happen when APEI doesn't claim the external-abort as a RAS
notification. If there were CPER records to process then the error is handled by
the host, and we can return to the guest.

If this wasn't a firmware-first notification, then you're right KVM hands the
guest an asynchronous external abort. This could be considered a bug in KVM. (we
can discuss with Marc and Christoffer what it should do), but:

I'm not sure what scenario you could see this in: surely all your
CPU:external-aborts are taken to EL3 by SCR_EL3.EA and become firmware-first
notifications. So they should always be claimed by APEI.

Once you're into a guest the original 'true hardware exception' shouldn't
matter. In this scenario KVM has handed the guest an SError, our question is 'is
it an SEI notification?':

For firmware first the guest OS should poke around in the CPER buffers, find
nothing to do, and return to the arch code for (future) kernel-first.
For kernel first the guest OS should trawl through the v8.2 ERR registers, find
nothing to do, and continue to the default case:

By default, we should panic on SError, unless its classified as a non-fatal RAS
error. (I'm tempted to pr_warn_once() if we get RAS notifications but there is
no work to do).


What you may be seeing is some awkwardness with the change in the SError ESR
with v8.2. Previously the VSE mechanism injected an impdef SError, (but they
were all impdef so it didn't matter).
With VSESR_EL2 KVM has to specify one, and all-zeros is a bad choice as this
means 'classified as a RAS error ... unknown!'.

I have a patch in the upcoming SError/RAS series that changes KVMs virtual-abort
code to specify an impdef ESR for this path.

Yes, while we don't expect a FAR with an SError, but we do expect a valid
representation of the RAS error in either the CPER records or the v8.2. ERR
registers (or both). If we have neither of those, its not a RAS error and we
should panic.

If its a RAS error APEI (or in the future, the kernel-first handler), should
claim the error, so the guest never sees it. If you are hitting this behaviour
in KVM, then it wasn't a RAS error.

The patch you posted during the merge window made no sense on its own, so must
replace $one_of the other patches in your v5 (or was it v6)... I'll get to it...

Because the SEI notification depends on v8.2 I'd like to get the SError/RAS
series posted (currently re-testing), then I'll pick up enough of the patches
you've posted for a consolidated version of the series, and we can take the
discussion from there.

I'd still like to know what your firmware does if the normal-world believes its
masked physical-SError and you want to hand it an SEI notification.


Thanks,

James
