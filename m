Hi Daniel,

This patch depends on patch #7, so it's not possible to merge for now.

The plan suggested to merge the series is divided in 3 steps:

   1) Patch #1-#2 are merged via your tree
      Patch #2-#6 are merged via the irqchip-tree
   2) Patch #7-#8 are merged via the KVM tree
   3) Patch #9 (this patch) is merge via your tree

I can ping you when the steps 1 and 2 are completed.

Regards,
