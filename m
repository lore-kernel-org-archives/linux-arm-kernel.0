The syscall ABI could be almost completely abstracted in glibc, the
main issue is ioctl and a couple of related interfaces that pass data
structures (read() on /dev/input/*, mmap on /dev/snd/*
or raw sockets, fcntl).

The question whether a data type is laid out like a 64-bit architecture
would cannot be a property of the type in most of those cases,
because the same types are used elsewhere. Many ioctls just
take a pointer to a 'long' or similar, and then you have structures
like 'timespec' that are used both in syscall/ioctl ABI and in normal
user space code, but are required to be laid out differently there.
(timespec is a bad example because y2038 of course, but it
illustrates the point).

This point was actually the most important one for keeping the
aarch64 ilp32 interface as restricted as it is: it doesn't allow
anything that the normal aarch32/armv7 emulation doesn't
already provide.
