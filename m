No, you're right, it wouldn't help.  I didn't look at the drivers/cpuidle
subsystem at all in my patch, since I'm not that familiar with it,
but it seems like tagging acpi_processor_ffh_cstate_enter(), as the
only user of mwait_idle_with_hints(), will do the job.

I do see that native_play_dead() also uses mwait/monitor, but since
that's hotplug I don't think it's relevant to this patch series.

The easiest way to check for a given function is just to look
at the "nm -n" output and see that all the functions you expect
to reflect idle behavior are in the cpuidle begin/end range.
Or, to look at "objdump -dr" and search for monitor/mwait.

objdump -h certainly works to show .cpuidle.text if you look at
individual objects (e.g. arch/x86/kernel/process.o) but by the time
you're looking at the linked vmlinux image they have all been linked
into the giant .text section.
