These are all great, but I think whether to use them or not should
depend on the compiler version rather than the architecture in
general. Do we know a minimum gcc version that supports all of the
above? Then we could put that code into the generic files.

If that's not possible, we could still make the implementation
available for other architectures by moving it to

asm-generic/bitops/builtin-__ffs.h
asm-generic/bitops/builtin-ffs.h
asm-generic/bitops/builtin-__fls.h
asm-generic/bitops/builtin-fls.h

What?

I suppose this is a leftover from an earlier version using the
generic bitops, right?
