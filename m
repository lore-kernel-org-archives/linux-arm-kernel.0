I'm not sure what you mean.

A driver which uses dma_alloc_coherent() directly should
work. dma_alloc_coherent() allocates memory with GFP_DMA with that
patch for dmabounce devices. So the driver gets the access-able
memory.

The memory that dma_alloc_coherent() returns should be always
consistent. We can't bounce it. All we can do is returning a memory
that a device (and its bus) can access to.

Krzysztof, can you try the patch?

Sorry, the original ARM code is wrong. dev->dma_mask and
dev->coherent_dma_mask represent the driver of dma restriction. ARM
tries to use them for both a driver and a bus so ARM needs a
workaround that doesn't set the driver of dma restriction to
dev->dma_mask and dev->coherent_dma_mask.

The proper solution is having a separate dma mask for a bus. I think
that POWERPC already does the similar. It has max_direct_dma_addr in
struct dev_archdata, which represents the dma restriction of a bus.
