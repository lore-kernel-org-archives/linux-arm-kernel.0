Subject: [PATCH v8 04/10] arm: dts: sunxi: h3/h5: represent the mdio switch
 used by sun8i-h3-emac
In-Reply-To: <20171023185626.31793-1-clabbe.montjoie@gmail.com>
References: <20171023185626.31793-1-clabbe.montjoie@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <20171023185626.31793-5-clabbe.montjoie@gmail.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Since dwmac-sun8i could use either an integrated PHY or an external PHY
(which could be at same MDIO address), we need to represent this selection
by a MDIO switch.
