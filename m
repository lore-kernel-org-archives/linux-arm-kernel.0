Actually, I think the problem was to ensure that the guest never sees
a spurious trap to EL1 when from its point of view FPEXC.EN is set.
Such a trap shouldn't architecturally happen, but if we execute the
guest with FPEXC.EN=0 when the guest thinks it should be 1 then a trap
to EL1 can occur irrespective of CPTR_EL2, because CPTR_EL2 only traps
things that wouldn't otherwise trap to EL1.

I'm not sure whether that's the question you intended to ask:
with EN set and TFP set, everything gets trapped to EL2, giving
us a chance to switch in the FP regs, which sounds like the
intended behaviour.

I think the full set of relevant possibilities looks like this:

	TFP	EN	FPEXC	fpregs
	0	0	 -	EL1
	0	1	 -	 -
	1	0	EL2	EL1
	1	1	EL2	EL2

Here, "TFP" is CPTR_EL2.TFP (or VHE equivalent) and EN is FPEXC (or
FPEXC32_EL2 depending on your point of view) . EN.

The FPEXC and fpregs columns show what happens when attempting to access
the FPEXC or other fp regs respectively from the guest.  - indicates no
trap taken, otherwise I list the destination EL for the trap.

(assuming I've interpreted the rules correctly of course).
