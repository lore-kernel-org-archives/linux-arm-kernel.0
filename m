Subject: [PATCH v3 3/9] KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: GICv2 IGROUPR should read as zero

We currently don't support grouping in the emulated VGIC, which is a
known defect on KVM (not hurting any currently used guests as far as
we're aware). This is currently handled by treating all interrupts as
group 0 interrupts for an emulated GICv2 and always signaling interrupts
as group 0 to the virtual CPU interface.

However, when reading which group interrupts belongs to in the guest
from the emulated VGIC, the VGIC currently reports group 1 instead of
group 0, which is misleading.  Fix this temporarily before introducing
full group support by changing the hander to _raz instead of _rao.

Fixes: fb848db39661a "KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Add GICv2 MMIO handling framework"
