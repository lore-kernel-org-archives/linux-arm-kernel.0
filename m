Subject: [PATCH] i2c: samsung: resume race fix

Don't unmark the device as suspended until after it's been re-setup.

The main race would be w.r.t. an i2c driver that gets resumed at the same
time (asyncronously), that is allowed to do a transfer since suspended
is set to 0 before reinit, but really should have seen the -EIO return
instead.
