I agree that eventually we'll want more than 256 vcpus. However the kvm
api already has the concept of a vcpu-index, which shows up in two other
places, KVM_IRQ_LINE and KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_*. In both those other places
it's only 8 bits. While there may not be a KVM_VCPU_INDEX_MASK=0xff
somewhere, I still think we should keep things consistent.

Hmm, or each device should define its own index. Actually, that sounds
better, as each device may have a different max-vcpus limit; KVM_IRQ_LINE
has 8 bits due to the x86 apic supporting 8 bits, gicv2 could have gotten
by with only 3 bits, and gicv3 can use much, much more. When we want more
than 256 vcpus we'll need a new kvm-irq-line ioctl, but, as for the arm
devices, we could avoid the problem completely by extending the
SET/GET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctl to also be a vcpu ioctl.

I knew you are consistent with arm-vgic.txt, and also with KVM_IRQ_LINE.
I was just thinking that it'd be nice for everything to be consistent
with KVM_CREATE_VCPU. However, now I'm of the mind that the vcpu-id
(32 bits) should always be independent of device vcpu-indexes, as we
don't want to limit the number of vcpus (by limiting vcpu-ids) to the
maximum of the most-limited device we support.

It's fine, as the specification in SET/GET_DEVICE_ATTR section isn't
going to change, but we require users of this api to read that section
already, so I feel it's redundant and prefer to avoid redundancy. I won't
insist.

Whether or not a user would define a VCPU_ID_MASK == 0xff depends on
whether or not they understand 'vcpu-index' to be a consistent concept
everywhere they see it in the documentation. I now would prefer
vcpu-index being device specific. Going that way, then I think the
documentation could be updated to help make that clearer, e.g. calling
the gic vcpu-index gic_vcpu_index or something.
