Hi Marc,

I tested your series on Calxeda Midway (shared device path)
Tested-by: Eric Auger <eric.auger@linaro.org>. No exotic migration use
case though.

I also exercised the non-shared device path. As already discussed some
adaptations where needed in vgic state machine.

If anyone is interested, the rebase with EOIMode == 1 + vgic/irqchip
adaptations + kvm-vfio series can be found at
https://git.linaro.org/people/eric.auger/linux.git/shortlog/refs/heads/v4.1-rc6-state-switch-forward.
Tested with Calxeda midway xgmac passthrough.

Eric
