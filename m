Unfortunately, there is more to downgrading to EL1 than just interrupts.
You need to migrate the whole VM context from EL2 to EL1 in an atomic
fashion, clear the HCR_EL2.E2H and HCR_EL2.TGE bits while running at EL2
(which is a bit like pulling the rug from under your own feet so you
need to transition via a low mapping or an idmap), reinstall the EL2
stub and do an exception return into EL1.

And that's only for the CPU. Downgrading to EL1 has other fun
consequences at the system level (SMMUs listening to TLB traffic would
need to be reconfigured on the flight - it's a joke, don't even think of
it).

Disabling KVM support won't drop the kernel to EL1. At least that's not
what the current code does (we stay at EL2 if we detect VHE), and that's
way too early to be able to parse a command line option.

I can't really see what you want to emulate (I'm afraid I'm lacking the
x86-specific background).

As far as I can see, the only practical solution to this is to have a
VHE config option, and Jailhouse that can be set to conflict it (depends
on !VHE).
