Hi,

(sorry for the delay, forgot this in my draft folder)

  ^^^^^^^^^^^   vgic_mmio_read_pending  ;-)

So while I agree that one can build a case on why the *current* code
might be actually safe without the lock, I think this is a very fragile
approach. As documented, the lock protects the consistency of the
members of the data structure. Full stop. So whenever we access
multiple members, we should take the lock.
If - and only if - we:
- get a lot of contention on the lock, and
- we care about this, and
- we can prove that it's safe without the lock
*then* it would be fine to remove this. And it would need to be heavily
documented, possibly even with BUG()s.

Everything else looks like premature optimisation that even might break
in the future once we for instance extend irq_is_pending() for whatever
reason. Even today I am not sure that just reading
"irq->pending_latch || irq->line_level" is safe without a lock,
regardless of the configuration state.

In this particular case all other users take the lock, so this looked
like a case where we have just forgotten this.
And as hinted above, ISPENDR in a guest is probably not a frequently
accessed register.

I believe we don't disagree on the matter, actually, but I'd be cautious
and rather take the lock than avoid it, if in doubt.

Cheers,
Andre.
