As an aside, it looks like any ptdump usage when KASAN is enabled takes
several minutes, which at boot time looks like a hang.

AFAICT, this is because KASAN allocates *huge* VA ranges (4TB+) worth of
zeroed shadow memory at pte granularity (reusing the same pmd, pud,
tables), and the ptdump code dutifully walks this with, with the added
KASAN instrumentation overhead.

I'll try to dig into that tomorrow; I suspect/hope it's not necessary to
keep all of that mapped.

Thanks,
Mark.
