Just in case it wasn't clear, the kernel can be loaded at any address in
RAM (and the RAM can start at any sane address). The way the kernel
calculates PHYS_OFFSET is (load address - TEXT_OFFSET) unless we pass it
by other means (none currently specified). For a kdump kernel, it just
assumes that its PHYS_OFFSET is higher but it can ioremap the crashed
kernel memory.
