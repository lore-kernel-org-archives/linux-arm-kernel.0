This looks fine to me, the execution of task_sve_discard() is nearly a
no-op with the current code.

We still have some local_bh_disable/enable() calls, though I don't think
it's worth optimising them now (e.g. having a
fpsimd_preserve_current_state_and_discard_sve() function with a
"sve_discard" argument to task_fpsimd_save() to force this).
