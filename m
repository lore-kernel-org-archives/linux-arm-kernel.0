I don't understand what the requirements here are exactly but the KVM
API documentation says:

  In general file descriptors can be migrated among processes by means
  of fork() and the SCM_RIGHTS facility of unix domain socket.  These
  kinds of tricks are explicitly not supported by kvm.  While they will
  not cause harm to the host, their actual behavior is not guaranteed by
  the API.  The only supported use is one virtual machine per process,
  and one vcpu per thread.

So this code should maintain those semantics and it's fair to assume the
thread group leader of a given VM stays the same, but the code must not
rely on this fact for safe operations.

I also don't see why a process couldn't open multiple VMs; however
messy that may be, it appears possible to me.
