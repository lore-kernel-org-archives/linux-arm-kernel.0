The exact scenario is related to the MOVI command, which changes the
affinity of the interrupt and also move any pending state from another
CPU. There is no guarantee that these two actions are completed
atomically w.r.t the delivery of interrupts to CPUs.

We *could* make it atomic, but that would be quite heavy handed.
