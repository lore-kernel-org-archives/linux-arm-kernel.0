I've always considered it to be more of a complexity issue. If an
interface can fail for half a dozen different reasons, it's useful to be
able to encapsulate this and pass it down the line to the consumer
(particularly in cases where no useful debug output is provided, and the
first thing someone is going to do is go and instrument the registration
path with printks to figure out where things went wrong). In the case
where the work to do is relatively straightforward and there's not much
complexity, NULL is clearly the way to go.

There are already quite a few cases today converting NULLs over to
arbitrary ERR_PTR values or IS_ERR cases wrapping back to NULL, so it's
clear that both have to be supported interacting with one another
regardless. Then there's that whole IS_ERR_OR_NULL case which everyone
seems to get wrong, but that's another issue entirely.
