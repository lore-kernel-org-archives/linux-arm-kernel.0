Thanks Marc for working on this.

I tested this series based on your git branch:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/maz/arm-platforms.git/log/?h=kvm-arm64/gicv3-cpuif-mediated-access

This does indeed fix the problems we were seeing, so feel free to add:

Tested-by: David Daney <david.daney@cavium.com>

to the entire series.

I would note that with these patches we see an occasional:

[ 3868.311491] Unexpected interrupt 4 on vcpu ffff801f57a6a020
[ 4262.063419] Unexpected interrupt 4 on vcpu ffff801f5b3dc040
[ 4262.063422] Unexpected interrupt 4 on vcpu ffff801f50972020

This is better than locking up the system, but I wonder if it indicates 
that improvement to the code is still possible.
