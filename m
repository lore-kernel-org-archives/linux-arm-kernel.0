Subject: [PATCH v2 2/6] arm64: KVM: Handle Set/Way CMOs as NOPs if FWB is
 present

Set/Way handling is one of the ugliest corners of KVM. We shouldn't
have to handle that, but better safe than sorry.

Thankfully, FWB fixes this for us by not requiering any maintenance
whatsoever, which means we don't have to emulate S/W CMOs, and don't
have to track VM ops either.

We still have to trap S/W though, if only to prevent the guest from
doing something bad.
