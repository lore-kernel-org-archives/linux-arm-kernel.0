I should have duplicated the Kconfig description for IO_STRICT_DEVMEM
in the changelog, but the justification is simply that if the kernel
has a driver busily using a memory range, userspace needs to assert it
knows it is safe to access that range by disabling the driver.  This
makes the kernel safer by default.

It certainly diminishes debug capabilities, mmap of sysfs pci
resources will also fail while a driver is active.  The only general
purpose application I know that uses /dev/mem is dosemu.  It should
continue to work fine as x86 "devmem_is_allowed()" permits access from
0-to-1MB by default.  The other stated user of /dev/mem legacy X
drivers.  With the prevalence of kernel modesetting in graphics
drivers I don't know how much of a concern this is anymore.

We have the "iomem=" kernel parameter.  I think it makes sense to have
that setting be configurable at runtime to augment this build time
decision.

dd through /dev/pmem and the driver will do all the proper flushing
and syncing to make the writes durable on media.  /dev/mem knows none
of those semantics.  /dev/pmem as a block device responds to O_EXCL
and prevents other attempts to open the device.

It seems to me that letting /dev/mem do arbitrary access to any region
of memory is a dangerous capability for a production environment.
Drivers assume that request_mem_region() tells other parts of the
kernel to not touch their memory.  Having the option to extend that
protection to /dev/mem by default seemed a reasonable idea.

Of course, all of this assumes that you think it is worthwhile to have
some protections and safety measures even for root.

I'll fold the eventual result of this discussion into the changelog if
I can convince you it's worth moving forward.

I also have the option of just tagging the pmem regions as
IORESOURCE_EXCLUSIVE, but I decided against that because I think our
current definition of STRICT_DEVMEM leaves a big hole if the goal is
"/dev/mem access is safe by default".
