Subject: [PATCH] kvm: arm64: Disable compiler instrumentation for hypervisor
 code
Message-ID: <1458558017-6414-1-git-send-email-catalin.marinas@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

With the recent rewrite of the arm64 KVM hypervisor code in C, enabling
certain options like KASAN would allow the compiler to generate memory
accesses or function calls to addresses not mapped at EL2. This patch
disables the compiler instrumentation on the arm64 hypervisor code for
gcov-based profiling (GCOV_KERNEL), undefined behaviour sanity checker
(UBSAN) and kernel address sanitizer (KASAN).

A better fix, at least for KASAN, would be nice but that's a lot more
intrusive as we need to map the KASAN shadow into the EL2 space. In the
meantime, especially since it needs backporting to 4.5, this patch would
solve KASAN getting stuck with KVM (similar to what we do for EFI_STUB).
