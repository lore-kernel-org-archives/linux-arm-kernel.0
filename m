Hmmm, yes.  Anyway, I've applied the above fix, so I think this should
be fine now.

Will do.  It's pretty yucky.

Hmmm, I think I'm guilty of inventing a spurious argument here.


Apparently gdb does not do syscall cancelling.

Strace does though.
(See http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html, search for
"syscall tampering" ;)

However, it never tries to skip a syscall entirelity AFAICT:
instead, it only attempts to fake what occurs during the syscall,
such as bailing out with a predetermined return value.

I think you're right.

Simulating the content of the syscall does work though, and doesn't
depend on whether SVE discard occurs or not.

If the tracer sets the SVE regs at the syscall enter/exit traps,
they could still be discarded again before the tracee reenters
userspace, but that's no different from what happens in a real
syscall.


So I think my overall argument would be:

ptrace should be as orthogonal as possible to SVE discard.


Currently ptrace neither assumes that SVE discard will happen or that it
won't: it just does what the tracer asks for and tries to be safe with
either and doesn't try to hide the effects from the tracer or tracee.

I worry that introducing more interdependencies between ptrace and the
fpsimd.c code will complicate maintenance rather than making it easier.

Does that may my position clearer?

If we go with this, I should add a note to the documentation explaining
how NT_ARM_SVE writes interact with ptrace syscall traps.


The alternative would be to forcibly discard SVE in
syscall_trace_enter(), but this doesn't seem to simplify the NT_ARM_SVE
implementation at all -- that code needs to work for all types of
ptrace-stop, not just syscall traps: other that syscall traps, SVE
is potentially live for the tracee and must not be discarded.
So I'm still not clear on what the gain is.
