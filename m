A version of this patch has been queued by Catalin.

Now that the cpufeature bits are queued, I think this can be split up into two
separate series for v4.16-rc1, one to tackle NOTIFY_SEI and the associated
plumbing. The second for the KVM 'make SError pending' API.

I didn't sign-off this patch. If you pick some bits from another version and
want to credit someone else you can 'CC:' them or just mention it in the
commit-message.

Irrelevant-Nit: sys-regs usually have a 'SYS_' prefix, and are in instruction
encoding order lower down the file.

(These PSTATE PAN things are a bit odd as they were used to generate and
instruction before the fancy {read,write}_sysreg() helpers were added).

Bits of this are spread between patches 5 and 6. If you put them in the other
order this wouldn't happen.

(but after a rebase most of this patch should disappear)

So this writes an impdef ESR, because its the existing code-path in KVM.

And then you overwrite it. Which is a bit odd as there is a helper to do both in
one go:

How come you don't use this in kvm_arm_set_sei_esr()?
