Indeed, I think we've discussed this before, and I don't imagine we'll 
be changing the actual behaviour of the existing allocators any time soon.

[ I still don't see that as an excuse for callers not to be fixed, 
though - anyone allocating something that may be exposed to userspace 
has a responsibility to initialise it appropriately. After all, the DMA 
API is just one source, what do we do if such a careless subsystem got 
some uninitialised pages of leftover sensitive data from, say, 
alloc_pages() instead? ]

That's a bit of a separate issue though. If a driver itself _needs_ a 
zeroed buffer but doesn't specifically request one, or doesn't get one 
even if it did, then that's just a regular bug, and it's what this patch 
is intended to help weed out. We've no need for a special poison value 
for data protection in the general case; zero is just fine for that.

It depends on DMA_API_DEBUG, which already has a stern performance 
warning, is additionally hidden behind EXPERT, and carries a slightly 
flippant yet largely truthful warning that actually using it could break 
pretty much every driver in your system; is that not enough?

If I was feeling particularly antagonistic, I'd also point out that as 
discussed above you've already taken the hit of a memset(0) and cache 
flush that you _didn't_ ask for, and there was no warning on that ;)

The intent is a specific troubleshooting tool - realistically it's 
probably only usable at all when restricting DMA debug to a per-driver 
basis. My hunch is that nobody's too fussed about the performance of a 
driver that doesn't work properly, especially once they've reached the 
point of dumping buffers in an attempt to figure out why, when seeing 
the presence or not of uniform poison values could be helpful.

(Of course, sometimes you end up debugging the allocator itself - see 
commit 7132813c3845 - which was one of the motivating factors for this 
patch).

Robin.
