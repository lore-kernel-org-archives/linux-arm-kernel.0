I don't think this is a fix to extract_bytes.  I think the issue is with
how we build the values.  I though the semanticsehre were that the u32
value in this case would the entire 32-bit register, so can't we simply
mask off the lower bits in the addr on entry to these functions and add
additional checks if there are registers where specifically do not wish
to support byte accessed?
