Hi Tyler

Thanks for taking a look!

Gah, One of the things I've tried to enforce is that notifications that happen
in_nmi() always happen in_nmi(): but that isn't the case for this first
ghes_proc() call, which always happens in process context.

Why didn't this happen to me? I'm assuming your GHES has work to do prior to
probing, but I waited for it to finish booting before generating test events.

The smallest fix is to have an irq/nmi fixmap and lock. This probe time call
would always use the irq fixmap and lock, and can be safely interrupted by an
NMI. Its only the NMI notifications interacting that we need to worry about as
they can't be masked.


Thanks!

James
