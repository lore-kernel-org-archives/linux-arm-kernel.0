Firstly, userspace will call kvm device ioctl to create the PMU device, 
if it fails it will return an error.
Secondly, userspace will call SET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctl to configure the PMU 
irq number. If the irq is invalid, this will return an error and the 
userspace will stop if it takes care the error. If the irq is valid, the 
PMU is well initialized.

If userspace doesn't call SET_ATTR ioctl to configure the PMU irq, the 
PMU is not well initialized and guest can't use the PMU.

I didn't see anywhere that needs to call something like 
KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_CTRL_INIT to let kvm initialize PMU because it will be 
initialized when userspace configure the irq correctly. This is a little 
different with the vGIC I think.
