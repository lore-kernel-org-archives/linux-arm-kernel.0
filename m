Debatable.  I'm a bit unfomfortable just leaving the kernel to bleed to
death of its own accord.  OTOH, if this allocation fails, the kernel is
unlikely to survive long enough to do any real damage.

Unfortunately we're in a call chain that leads to a void function
called from core code, so returning an error is impossible.  I'm very
unconvinved that applying percpu offset on NULL will result in
something that is "NULL enough" to guarantee a fault.  Perhaps this is
supposed to be a guarantee of the percpu design, but I've seen no
statement about this anywhere.

A similar quandary also effects
drivers/firmware/efi/arm-init.c:efi_init().  In the end I followed its
lead, but I don't know which answer is correct.

Hmm, looks like it.  I just followed the pattern I'd already set, but
it looks like efi_fpsimd_state and efi_fpsimd_state_used ought to be
static too.

I'll fix those, though it'll be a separate patch since Catalin already
took the EFI fpsimd stuff.

Argh, I always seem to have a blind spot about this one.

(I do disagree with this rule, but that's another story...)

Will fix, and I'll double check whether any others instances of this
slipped through.

Do you mean add braces around the else clause?  It looks like I should
add those for consistency.

Otherwise, I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  I don't think the
nature of the _condition_ has any bearing on this (?)

Thanks, I'll hold off on applying that until we've concluded on the
above.
