A nit but we removed such guards in the other header files.

I also checked mod_arch_specific structure because of the way we deal 
with relocations. It is defined only if CONFIG_ARM64_MODULE_PLTS is 
enabled and there is a pointer to 'struct elf64_shdr' called plt. It is 
used indirectly in apply_relocate_add() so we need it to stay. However it 
points to an existing Elf section and SHF_ALLOC is added to its sh_flags 
in module_frob_arch_sections() (arch/arm64/kernel/module-plts.c). 
Therefore we should be ok.

Jessica, could you check it as well, please?

Thanks,
Miroslav
