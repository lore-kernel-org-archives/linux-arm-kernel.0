This is all to make 'KSMA' harder, where an single arbitrary write is used to
add a block mapping to the page-tables, giving the attacker full access to
physical memory.

This series is pretty complicated, and would still be overcome by arbitrary-read
of __pa_swapper_pg_dir. Any attacker already has to defeat KASLR, but I guess
that can be done without having read-access.

This is where we migrated swapper_pg_dir to, its the first memblock_alloc()
call, and is guaranteed to be at the top of memory. Moving this allocation later
will still cause a predictable page to be allocated as this setup code is the
only thing running. I don't think we are in a better position after this series.


Ideally we would put these pgd entries in the read-only section. We only modify
swapper_pg_dir for vmalloc()/vmap() once its generated, which we could do
through a fixmap entry.

Like this, an attacker can find where swapper_pg_dir is, but can't write to it.
(the tricky bit will be breaking swapper_pg_dir up, as we free parts of it)


Thanks,

James
