Subject: [GIT PULL] Late arm64 KVM fix for 4.2
Message-ID: <20150827180244.GE23520@arm.com>

Hi Linus,

I appreciate that it's extremely late in the cycle, but we've uncovered
a nasty bug in the arm64 KVM code which allows a badly behaved 32-bit
guest to bring down the host. The fix is simple (it's what I believe we
call a "brown paper bag" bug) and I don't think it makes sense to sit on
this, particularly as Russell ended up triggering this rather than just
somebody noticing a potential problem by inspection.

Usually arm64 KVM changes would go via Paolo's tree, but he's on holiday
at the moment and the deal is that anything urgent gets shuffled via
the arch trees, so here it is. Please pull.

Cheers,

Will

Urgent arm64 KVM fix for 4.2:

Fix arm64 KVM issue when injecting an abort into a 32-bit guest, which

crash.
