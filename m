When you do get_task_pid(current, PIDTYPE_PID) it actually gets the
kernel view of a PID which is the thead-id from userspace's point of
view, right?

I don't see why this has to be the same as the debugfs code, as there it
makes potentially more sense to thread-specific, but for your case, are
you not targeting the behavior that a user can do "ps aux | grep qemu"
or whatever, and then set tracing for the reported PID (which is
actually a tgid)?

If this is indeed the case, then I don't think the current code supports
this if QEMU was ever changed to create the VM with a different thread
than the tgl.

That being said, I'm typically wrong when I talk about userspace.
