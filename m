FWIW, that looks good to me.

Sure. I do some testing with mem= to find some bugs. The problem is that
you can only vary the end address (prior to your patches), and don't get
much variation on the portions in the middle.

It's difficult to test for bugs with not-quite-adjacent regions, or
where particular sizes, alignment, or addresses are important.

For example, having memory that extends right to the end of the
kernel-supported PA range (even with gaps in the middle) is an edge case
we don't currently test. I have a suspicion that KASAN's shadow
lookahead (and allocation to account for this) wouldn't be quite right,
and I want to be able to properly test and verify that.

Thanks,
Mark.
