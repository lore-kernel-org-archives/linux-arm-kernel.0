So I ran this through GDB, and this happens when the guest probes the
virtio devices, specifically the backtrace tells me that

virtio_current_cpu_endian () at /root/src/qemu/hw/virtio/virtio.c:594
=> cc->virtio_is_big_endian
  -> arm_cpu_is_big_endian
    -> cpu_synchronize_state
      -> kvm_cpu_synchronize_state

which causes cpu->kvm_vcpu_dirty = true, which causes the run-loop to
write the CNTVOFF on a per-vcpu basis without stopping anything, as far
as I can tell.

So yeah, I guess the only required fix here is to fix QEMU in some way
as to not fiddle with the timer registers in this way, and then I
honestly don't know if we should try to fix legacy userspace in the
kernel, but based on the feedback from Jan, I suppose not.

Thanks,
