I do not know when it is merge-window. About the apply version, it does not have limited.

OK, thanks!

I have replied the mail.
I still have some questions that need to clarify with you.
After clarification, we will follow that.
The question is in the reply of this mail "https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel at vger.kernel.org/msg1611496.html"

Let us  discuss that in another mail.
In a summary, I think firmware follow below rule can be OK, right?
1. The exception came from the EL that SError should be routed to(according to hcr_EL2.{AMO, TGE}),but PSTATE.A was set, EL3 firmware can't deliver SError;
2. The exception came from the EL that SError should not be routed to(according to hcr_EL2.{AMO, TGE}),even though the PSTATE.A was set,EL3 firmware still deliver SError
