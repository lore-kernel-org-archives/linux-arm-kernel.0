Indeed.

Yes, assuming we're not holding any other spinlock on the same path.
Looking at the code, we only seem to come here from handling MAPI/MAPTI,
so we should be good.

Ah, I see what you mean now (I was obviously looking at the wrong end of
the problem).

I think that should be the case. What does it mean to do two restore in
parallel? We should probably enforce this. Eric?
