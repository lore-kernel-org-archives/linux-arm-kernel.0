Yes it is.

No. We're implementing a monolithic GICv3 that doesn't offer writing to
the redistributors directly from a device. And frankly, that's good enough.

Sure. And you then have to parse and validate all the tables each and
every time you're going to inject an interrupt (because the guest can
change the table content behind your back). You are quickly going to
notice that your performance is abysmal.

At that point, you're going to start being clever, and add a cache. And
guess what, that's what the HW does too. And then you'll make your cache
a convenient structure to be able to quickly inject interrupts. And
that's what the HW does too. And finally, you're going to realize that
populating a cache sucks, and you're going to keep all the state where
it is convenient, when it is convenient (and that's basically always).

The HW can't do that, but we can.
