Happy to use whatever since, as you say, it's cosmetic. Perhaps -EAGAIN?

In my initial code inspection that we could block waiting for the
cred_guard mutex, with exec holding it, exec would schedule death in
de_thread, and then once it released, the tsync thread would try to
keep running.

However, in looking at this again, now I'm concerned this produces a
dead-lock in de_thread, since it waits for all threads to actually
die, but tsync will be waiting with the killable mutex.

So I think I got too defensive when I read the top of de_thread where
it checks for pending signals itself.

It seems like I can just safely remove the singal_group_exit checks?
The other paths (non-tsync seccomp_set_mode_filter, and
seccomp_set_mode_strict) would just run until it finished the syscall,
and then died. I can't decide which feels cleaner: just letting stuff
clean up naturally on death or to short-circuit after taking
sighand->siglock.

What do you think?
