This penalises flush_dcache_page, while it might only be required for
__sync_icache_dcache (called when installing executable ptes).

Now, the job of flush_dcache_page is to deal with D-side aliases between
concurrent user and kernel mappings. On arm64, D-side aliasing is not a
problem so in theory flush_dcache_page could be a nop (well, a clear_bit,
but close enough).

The reason that flush_dcache_page *isn't* currently a nop, is because we
have harvard caches, so if we end up in a situation where the kernel is
writing executable text to a page which is also mapped into userspace (i.e.
there won't be a subsequent call to set_pte), then the user will execute
junk if we don't flush/invalidate things here.

This might be overkill. I can't think of a scenario where the above is true,
but I'm no mm expert, so it would be great if somebody else could chime in
to confirm/rubbish out suspicions...

Cheers,

Will
