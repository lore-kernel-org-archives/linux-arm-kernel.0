I'd really like to have a single kvm_exit macro, because userspace
scripts etc. count this event.

I thought about doing something more meaningful, but couldn't think of a
better way, and in any case, this needs to be fixed first and we can
always add something on top.

Patches are welcome :)

I anticipate this will not go in before the next merge window opens, and
surely the timer patch series in which ever form it ends up being in,
should go in before that, given that it fixes real issues, so hence the
way I sent out these patches.  No hidden agendas - for once ;)
