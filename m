Coming back to this, I agree with you, that we should check things when
we first start running.

Raising an error when trying to do something is slightly more user
friendly (you have a better hint of where the error comes from), but I'm
not convinced we already have that info at hand.

I think at this point we just have to make sure everything is consistent
before we run the VM.

I'm open to sugestions on how to make it more clean.

I believe the spec explicitly says that this is a programming error and
that OS code should never allow this.

Yeah, not nice.

I think this interaction also can happen if we let userspace set the
timer irq state using KVM_IRQ_LINE (as we already do), right?

I agree, I think we need it, unfortunately.
