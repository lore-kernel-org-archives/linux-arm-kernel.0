As I replied to myself, the above would work for me as well, so let's go
for this.

Because SW PAN has a non-trivial performance hit. You would enable SW
PAN only if you are paranoid about security. HW PAN, OTOH, is very cheap
and I wouldn't want to miss enabling it in a single Image supporting
ARMv8.0 and ARMv8.1 just because SW PAN is slow on ARMv8.0.

IOW, ARM64_PAN is default y while ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN is default n.
