Agreed.

For PMD the issue exists since commit ad361f093c1e ("KVM: ARM: Support
hugetlbfs backed huge pages") when the file lived in arch/arm/kvm. (v3.12+)

For PTE the issue exists since commit d5d8184d35c9 ("KVM: ARM: Memory
virtualization setup"). (v3.8+)

I'll split the fix into two patches and add a cc to stable.

Just noticed this. Looks like the commit hook has escaped it's worktree.

I went for the minimal change keeping a backport in mind.

The VM_BUG_ON() is enabled only when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is selected and
checks for pfn ignoring the attributes, while this fix checks for the
entire entry. Maybe I'm missing something, but I can't see an obvious
way to combine the checks.

I've eliminated the duplicate pmd_present() check and will post the
updated patches.

Thanks,
Punit
