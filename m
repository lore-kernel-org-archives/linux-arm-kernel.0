Mike did write "master IDs are hardwired to individual cores and core
security states", which make assignment for one platform very static.
On the flip side those will change from one system to another.

Some clarification here.

On ARM from a SW point of view $end == $start and that doesn't change
(with regards to masterIDs) .  The ambiguity comes from the fact that
on other platforms where masterID configuration does change and is
important, the condition $end == $start could also be valid.

>From configFS, how do we tell users when masterIDs are set in HW?
That's what I wanted to highlight with the '-1'.  Regardless of the
solution we choose I think it is important that we inform, at the very
least, users when masterIDs don't matter.  We could also leave thing
as is, kill this patch and document things thoroughly.  With the
former things are obvious.
