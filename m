Yes, that's where I initially came from anyway. Note that they are
mostly not spurious, they warn about something actually going really
wrong here (undefined behavior) though only after we noticed that it was
already pretty wrong (BUG_ON).

Yes, probably a good idea.

I think it still makes sense to keep them separate. With CONFIG_BUG=n,
we get no bug_table at all, while with CONFIG_BUGVERBOSE=n, we avoid
most of the data fields of the bug table but still try to print a
message tellung us that we hit a BUG().

not sure where I can find tinyconfig, this is what I get for ARM allnoconfig
(only totals, let me know if you need more details):

original:		961307
patched:		969167 (+0.82%)
CONFIG_BUG:		994695 (+3.36%)
CONFIG_BUGVERBOSE:    1003379 (+4.20%)

looking at the sections, my patch adds 3688 bytes to .text and the __modver
section grows from 0 to 4088 bytes, which is something I can't explain
at the moment, there doesn't really seem to be anything in it.

Note that this kernel also includes another patch I resubmitted the
other day at

http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.ports.arm.kernel/455995

Without that patch, the difference would be slightly bigger as we would
more often need two instructions for a BUG_ON rather than one.

Yes, I thought about that already and decided to keep the patch simple
instead. I can do that of course once we get consensus on the general
approach.
