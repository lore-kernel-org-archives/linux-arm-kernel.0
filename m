Ah! You're in charge, then! ;-)

For the record, the test case I've been running is this:

__start:
	mov	x19, #(1 << 20)

	mov	x0, #0x3fff0000		// Dist
	mov	x1, #0x3ffd0000		// CPU
	mov	w2, #1
	str	w2, [x0]		// Enable Group0
	ldr	w2, =0xa0a0a0a0
	str	w2, [x0, 0x400]		// A0 priority for SGI0-3
	mov	w2, #0x0f
	str	w2, [x0, #0x100]	// Enable SGI0-3
	mov	w2, #0xf0
	str	w2, [x1, #4]		// PMR
	mov	w2, #1
	str	w2, [x1]		// Enable CPU interface
	
1:
	mov	w2, #(2 << 24)		// Interrupt self with SGI0
	str	w2, [x0, #0xf00]

2:	ldr	w2, [x1, #0x0c]		// GICC_IAR
	cmp	w2, #0x3ff
	b.ne	3f

	wfi
	b	2b

3:	str	w2, [x1, #0x10]		// EOI

	sub	x19, x19, #1
	cbnz	x19, 1b

// Die
	mov	x0, #0x84000000
	add	x0, x0, #9
	hvc	#0
	b	.

Feel free to adapt it so it fits in your framework if you find it useful
(but I guess you'll be inclined to rewrite it in C).

Thanks,
