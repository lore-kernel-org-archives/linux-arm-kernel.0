Well, forget linux-arch, that's hopeless because that became a very
x86-centric linux-kernel-v2, and as such I refuse to subscribe to it -
it would be a total waste of my network bandwidth because I wouldn't
have time to read it.

I somehow suspect that linux-api isn't that much better either.  What
I want from any "arch" specific thing is a heads-up to alert me to
something so that I can then choose whether to look deeper at the
subject or just ignore it completely.  I don't want to be buried under
lots of x86 specific drivel about a new feature.

So, the reality is, that I don't see any of the new syscall discussions
anymore.  The first that I'm aware of them is when they hit in some way
that becomes visible to me - which is normally sometime during the merge
window.

It's not really about struct alignment, although that is a concern.
For ARM, it's more about argument alignment, and whether a 64-bit
argument gets passed in (eg) r1/r2 or r2/r3, and whether we run out
of registers to pass the arguments.

I'd still like to retain the ability to only add to EABI in the future.

I don't get that on my builds, for EABI or OABI - for EABI:

  CHK     include/generated/bounds.h
  CC      arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.s
  CHK     include/generated/asm-offsets.h
  CALL    /home/rmk/git/linux-rmk/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/rmk/git/build/hdrtst'

and for OABI:

  CHK     include/generated/bounds.h
  CC      arch/arm/kernel/asm-offsets.s
  CHK     include/generated/asm-offsets.h
  CALL    /home/rmk/git/linux-rmk/scripts/checksyscalls.sh
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/rmk/git/build/hdrtst-oabi'

So, I'd like to know how you're seeing that warning.  We have never
provided sync_file_range on ARM, and we must never define it, because
the user API for it is broken.

Well, I think you have a mis-merge somewhere, beacuse uapi/asm/unistd.h
does have:

#define __NR_sync_file_range2           __NR_arm_sync_file_range

in it, which triggers this in scripts/checksyscalls.sh:

/* sync_file_range had a stupid ABI. Allow sync_file_range2 instead */
#ifdef __NR_sync_file_range2
#define __IGNORE_sync_file_range
#endif

Hence why I don't see the warning you're seeing.

OABI-compat != ARM64-EABI-compat though.  They're two completely
different things.

Moreover, the syscall numbers ARM64 uses natively are completely
different from the syscall numbers 32-bit ARM uses, either for EABI
or OABI.  So I really don't see this working.

I've no idea how ARM64 deals with 32-bit binaries, so I can't comment
on how it deals with those syscalls, sorry.

Don't know, sorry.  I know virtually nothing about the differences
between the 64-bit and 32-bit ABIs, so I can't comment on anything
to do with the compat_* interfaces.

Why not - the point of syscallnr.sh is to remove the need to manually
update the __NR_syscalls definition, which is a generic kernel thing.
Unless other architectures just define a fixed-size table with plenty
of extra space, they'd need to adjust __NR_syscalls when adding new
calls.
