Making the call special-purpose makes it more natural to pull the printk
out of the call, solving the header issues.

This would be a bit gross in core code, but arm.c is supported to be
Arm-specific, so if you prefer this approach it doesn't look too bad
here.

I'm happy to rework along these lines.
