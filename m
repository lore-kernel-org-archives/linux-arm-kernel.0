There is really no point keeping both, because they are two views of the
same state. They perform different action on the same data, so the way
to look at it is to have different functions/methods that modify the
same state.

That's indeed the way it should be. You just have to register different
functions in the trap table. You could even move the register outside of
the sys_reg array into the kvm_pmu structure.
