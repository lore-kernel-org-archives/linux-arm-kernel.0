OK, so in that case, you can abuse your single arbitrary write to map
an entire 1 GB block of memory with arbitrary permissions, allowing
userland to take control of the contents, right? And if you know the
virtual and physical addresses of swapper_pg_dir, you can make sure
this block covers the entire kernel, allowing the attacker to
manipulate all core kernel code and statically allocated data
structures.

What I don't understand about this patch is how it is sufficient to
only remap swapper_pg_dir r/w for updates on kernels that use 4 level
paging.

Ah fair enough. So either the initial page tables are never referred
to via swapper_pg_dir in the first place, or we copy the first level
over from __initdata after setting it up (which is probably easier
than teaching the asm code about non-consecutive page ranges).

So indeed, that would be an improvement in its own right.

I think I prefer your suggestion above.

But we do need to teach this code to deal with folded page table levels.
