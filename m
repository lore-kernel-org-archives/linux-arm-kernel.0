I'm not clear on the motivation for this patch. I assumed it enabled
simpler patches later in the series, but I did a bit of reading ahead
and didn't see anything obvious. I doubt it gives a speedup, so is it
just to avoid stack use? Making it easier to maintain these assembly
functions that span a couple files? If so, should it be posted separately
from this series? If not, could you please add some more text to the
commit message helping me better understand the full motivation?

Besides my confusion on motivation, it looks good to me
