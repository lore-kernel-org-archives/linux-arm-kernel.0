intel_idle() also uses it.

# nm -n ivb-ep-build/vmlinux | awk '/__cpuidle_text_start/ {p=1} {if (p) print $0} /__cpuidle_text_end/ {p=0}'
ffffffff81b16ca8 T __cpuidle_text_start
ffffffff81b16cb0 T default_idle
ffffffff81b16e50 t mwait_idle
ffffffff81b17080 t cpu_idle_poll
ffffffff81b17280 T default_idle_call
ffffffff81b172be T __cpuidle_text_end

So no intel_idle for me..

Indeed.
