The bits[7:0] of the machine type has been reserved for the IPA shift.
This version is missing the updates to the ABI documentation, I have it
for the next version.

The stage2 pgd size is really dependent on the max IPA. Also, unlike the 
stage1 (where the maximum size will be 1 page), the size can go upto 16
pages (and different number of levels due to concatenation), so we need
to finalize this at least before the first memory gets mapped (RAM or 
Device). That implies, we cannot wait until all the memory slots are
created.

The first version of the series added a separate ioctl for specifying
the limit, which had its own complexities. So, this ABI was suggested
to keep things simpler.
