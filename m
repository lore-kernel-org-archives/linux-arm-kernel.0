Yes, I originally modified as well like your following patch, but at
that moment, I didn't get your agreement that the policy name (i.e. an
arbitrary string) cannot contain dots, so I had to consider the case.
Whatever, there isn't a panacea.  I'm very good with your patch.  Many
thanks for your review and providing the patch.
