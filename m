At the end of the day, the syscall slowpath code calls a bunch of
functions depending on what TIF_XYZ flags are set.  As long as it's
structured like "if (TIF_A) do_a(); if (TIF_B) do_b();" or something
like that, it's comprehensible.  But once random functions with no
explicit flag checks or comments start showing up, it gets confusing.

If it's indeed all-or-nothing, I could remove the check and add a
comment.  But please keep in mind that, currently, the slow path is
*slow*, and my patches only improve the entry case.  So enabling
context tracking on every task will hurt.
