I guess I can put a WARN_ONCE() there, wouldn't hurt. The fixmap approach would work, but it is just complicated on heterogeneous systems, as you'd have to have one fixmap entry per CPU type. I'm not looking forward to implementing this!

I guess that was an oversight in the Spectre patches, which lives on. I'll have a look at simplifying this.

It wasn't clear from the outset that this file would turn into something 
that is strictly KVM related. I could move it, but I'm not sure that'd 
make things simpler.

Something like this?
