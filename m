Depending on how many postinit_rodata variables there are, we might be
able to drop those in .rodata, have them RO always, and initialise them
via a temporary RW alias (e.g. something in the vmalloc area).

The only requirement for that is that we use a helper to initialise any
__postinit_ro variables via a temporary RW alias, e.g.

#define SET_POST_INIT_RO(ptr, v) ({ 		\\
	typeof(ptr) __ptr_rw = (ptr)		\\
	BUG_ON(initcalls_done);			\\
	__ptr_rw = create_rw_alias(__ptr);	\\
	__ptr_rw = v;				\\
	destroy_rw_alias(__ptr_rw);		\\
})

...

__postinit_ro void *thing;

void __init some_init_func(void) {
	void *__thing = some_ranodomized_allocator();
	SET_POSTINIT_RO(thing, thing);
}


Mark.
