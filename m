Subject: [PATCH 1/4] ARM: sun5i: dt: Add I2C muxings for sun5i A10S
In-Reply-To: <1373232719-13050-1-git-send-email-emilio@elopez.com.ar>
References: <1373232719-13050-1-git-send-email-emilio@elopez.com.ar>
Message-ID: <1373232719-13050-2-git-send-email-emilio@elopez.com.ar>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The information has been extracted from the A10S-OLinuXino-Micro
schematics, as we do not have a user manual for A10S yet.
