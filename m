I like the series, but I have one minor nit to pick.  The effect of
this series is to harden usercopy, but most of the code is really
about infrastructure to validate that a pointed-to object is valid.
Might it make sense to call the infrastructure part something else?
After all, this could be extended in the future for memcpy or even for
some GCC plugin to check pointers passed to ordinary (non-allocator)
functions.
