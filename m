My rational is that, as we don't disable FP access across most
exit/entry sequences, we still significantly benefit from the optimization.

Sysreg? That's not what I'm proposing. What I'm proposing here is that
we treat FP exception as a shallow exit that immediately returns to the
guest without touching them. The overhead is an extra save/restore of
the host's x19-x30, if I got my maths right. I agree that this is
significant, but I'd like to measure this overhead before we go one way
or the other.

I'd rather stick to the current C approach, no matter how we perform the
save/restore. It feels a lot more readable and maintainable in the long run.
