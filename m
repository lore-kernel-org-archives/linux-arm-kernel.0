Pseudocode indeed. T is the "trampoline page".

This is giving you the range of HYP VAs that can be safely used to map
kernel ranges.

I'm not sure. We're trying to determine the VA range that doesn't
conflict with a physical range. I don't see how introducing PHYS_OFFSET
is going to help, because we're only interested in a single page (the
trampoline page).

I think HYP_VA_SHIFT is actually contributing to the confusion, because
it has no practical impact on anything.

Well, I found it useful when I wrote it. What I meant is that we're
never going to alias a kernel mapping there.

As I said, I found this blurb useful when I was trying to reason about
the problem. I don't mind it being dropped.

Thanks,
