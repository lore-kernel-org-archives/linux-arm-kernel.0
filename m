Firstly, we am talking the RAS firmware-first solution. I mainly
want to let user space to know what is the Error type for this hardware error(Synchronous or asynchronous).
we do not care the notification mechanism. As our agreement before , Qemu will record the CPER for the
guest OS. if Qemu does not know the Error type, it can not record the CPER. because in the ghes there is a field to
fill the error type.

I paste the APEI table layout:
https://wiki.linaro.org/LEG/Engineering/Kernel/RAS/APEITables

usual the notification type is classified by the hardware type

I agree with you this sentence, for the hardware error, host kernel will firstly deal with, and then decided whether to
notified Qemu/KVM tools. In this process, we do not care what is the notification mechanism between
firmware and host kernel. we only concern the hardware error type. different type, Qemu/KVM tools will have different behavior.

 if want Qemu to handle this Error, I think qemu/kvmtools should know hardware error type, else it will be confused and do not know how to deal with.

 we do not care the notification type, we are only care the hardware error type.
 if user-space do not know the error type, it can not record the CPER and can not inject the proper Error to guest OS.
 because record CPER and inject the Error to guest OS need this hardware error type. different Error type, there is
 different behavior.

 For different hardware error type, X86 Qemu/kvm tools code also have different behaviour in

you may misunderstand I mentioned solution here. I mean using memory-failure code to signal user space
for the SError(SEI), this way does not creates any ABI. SEA/SEI all use same method.
Qemu can judge the ESR to know the hardware type.

  No, not merge them. in above steps, the steps 7 needs to know the hardware type. if it does not know the
  hardware error type, user space can not correctly do further processing. we do not care the notification type.
  we only care what is the hardware error type.

  so here can I understand that you also agree that SError type can also use signals to be delivered to user space?
