Subject: [PATCH v6 0/7] arm/arm64: vgic-new: Implement API for vGICv3 live
 migration
Message-ID: <1474351965-11586-1-git-send-email-vijay.kilari@gmail.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Vijaya Kumar K <Vijaya.Kumar@cavium.com>

This patchset adds API for saving and restoring
of VGICv3 registers to support live migration with new vgic feature.
This API definition is as per version of VGICv3 specification
http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-arm-kernel/2016-July/445611.html

Compatible live migration QEMU patches will be sent later.

The patch 3 & 4 are picked from the Pavel's previous implementation.
http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg122040.html

v5 => v6:
 - Collated all register definitions to single patch (4)
 - Introduce macro to convert userspace MPIDR format to MPIDR reg format
 - Check on ICC_CTLR_EL1.CBPR value is made while accessing ICC_BPR1_EL1
 - Cached ich_vtr_el2 and guests priority and ID bits
 - Check on number of priority and ID bits when ICC_CTRL_EL1 write is made
 - Check is made on SRE bit for ICC_SRE_EL1 write

v4 => v5:
 - ICC_CTLR_EL1 access is updated to reflect HW values
 - Updated ICC reg access mask and shift macros
 - Introduced patch 4 for VMCR changes
 - Other minor fixes.
v3 => v4:
 - Rebased to latest code base
 - Moved vgic_uaccess() from vgic-mmio-v2.c to vgic-mmio.c
 - Dropped macro REGISTER_DESC_WITH_BITS_PER_IRQ_SHARED_UACCESS
 - Dropped LE conversion for userspace access
 - Introduced vgic_uaccess_write_pending() for ISPENDR write
 - Change macro KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_V3_CPUID_MASK to KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_V3_MIDR_MASK
 - Refactored some code as common code.
 - Changed handing of ICC_* registers
 - Allowed ICC_SRE_EL1 read by userspace
 - Fixed KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_LINE_LEVEL_INFO_* macros

v2 => v3:
 - Implemented separate API for ISPENDR and ICPENDR to
   read soft_pending instead of pending for level triggerred interrupts
 - Implemented ioctl KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_LEVEL_INFO to access line level
 - Rebased on top of Christoffer's patch set
   http://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg136840.html

 NOTE: GICD_STATUSR and GICR_STATUSR are implemented as RAZ/WI.

v1 => v2:
 - The init sequence change patch is no more required.
   Fixed in patch 2 by using static vgic_io_dev regions structure instead
   of using dynamic allocation pointer.
 - Updated commit message of patch 4.
 - Dropped usage of union to manage 32-bit and 64-bit access in patch 1.
   Used local variable for 32-bit access.
 - Updated macro __ARM64_SYS_REG and ARM64_SYS_REG in
   arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h as per qemu requirements.
