you implied that what PaX does may not be correct. if you can't back that
up with facts and technical arguments then it is FUD. your turn.

exactly. start with explaining what is not correct in PaX with "precise
technical arguments".

good thing i didn't say that. on the other hand you failed to provide "precise
technical arguments" for why "playing games with the CR0.WP bit is outright
stupid to begin with". do you have any to share and discuss?

there's no difference to me, i keep my stuff sane regardless. of course what
you do with your out-of-tree code is your business but don't extrapolate it
to mine. now besides argumentum ad verecundiam do you have "precise technical
arguments" as to why maintaining a cr0.wp based approach would be "a nightmare
maintainence wise as it's prone to be broken over time."?

i don't see what subtle mistake you're thinking of here. can you give me
an example?

where such a leak is caught depends on what subtle mistake you're talking
about, so let's get back to this point once you answered that question.

open/close calls have nothing to do with error paths or even conditional
execution, they're always executed as a sequence so this situation cannot
occur.

it doesn't matter when the attacker has an arbitrary read/write primitive
which he can just use to modify that 'very restricted writeable region'
to whatever he needs to cover first. now if all the data managing this
region were also protected then it'd matter but that's never going to
happen in the upstream kernel.

it is, by definition assignments to otherwise __read_only data are (have to
be) bracketed with open/close instrumentation.

i can't imagine the nightmares you must have lived through for the two decades
during which the kernel was all wide open... spass beiseite, we can address
these fears of yours once you explain just what kind of error situations you
have in mind and why they don't also apply to say text_poke().

the lifetime and use of kmaps is very different so you'll have to explain
in more detail why the problems they had apply here as well.

i meant the one passed to the map/unmap code, attacker control over it means
the whole world is effectively writable again (Andy's vma approach would restrict
this to just the interesting read-only data except the whole thing is irrelevant
until all participating data (vma, page tables, etc) are also protected).
