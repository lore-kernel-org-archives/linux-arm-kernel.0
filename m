Thanks, Shanker. I'll pick this up (fixing the typo pointed out by Drew).

As I mentioned to Jayachandran for the Cavium patches [1], using an
unallocated SMC number like this may cause a problem for some platforms,
such as qemu. Using the PSCI GET_VERSION call avoids this issue, so I'm
relying on you to handle any breakage reports that arise from this change
then.

FWIW: we're currently looking into extending PSCI/SMCCC so that a
standardised mechanism can be implemented without the overhead of the
current register stacking requirements.

Cheers,

Will
