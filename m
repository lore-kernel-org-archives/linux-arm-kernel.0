Well, offset is horribly overloaded in our world, so let's stick with 'address'

Actually, I think I should drop it instead. The other alloc functions
only check for EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY, and this is intended to be
generic code. Also, I have never seen a system with
EFI_CONVENTIONAL_MEMORY with the WB bit cleared.

OK, I will fix that.

Sure. Note that in my local version, I already replaced max_weight
with total_weight since it wasn't entirely accurate. So I'll try to
pick a better name for target as well.
