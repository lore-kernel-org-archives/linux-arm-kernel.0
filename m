Ok, so that means if the guest maps RAM as uncached, it will actually
end up as cached memory. Now if the guest triggers a DMA request to a
passed through device to that RAM, it will conflict with the cache.

I don't know whether it's a big deal, but it's the scenario that came up
with the approach above before when I talked to people about it.
