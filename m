I'm always confused by a description like this. It sounds like you cannot
have a hypervisor if you have code running in secure mode in EL3. What
I instead understand is that you enter non-secure mode by going from
EL3 into EL2.

I've seen people put firmware for some peripherals into the device tree,
so that a device driver can grab a blob from there and load it into the
device, rather than calling request_firmware() which would fail if the
OS running on the system does not contain the blob. If such firmware is
too large, you end up violating the 2 MB limit you impose here.

Should we keep that limit and declare those use cases as invalid, or
should we try to make the boot protocol more flexible?

Is this necessary? The asm-generic version of this file allows 512 bytes,
which seems plenty.

EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL?

Neither of these looks like they should be used in drivers.
