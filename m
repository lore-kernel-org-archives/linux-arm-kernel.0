All the prctl flags that have equivalents here, because they're part of
the internal API to sve_set_vector_length().  It didn't quite seem
appropriate to document that in a userspace header, but it's probably
better to say something here than not.  I'll improve the comment.

There is a bug here though: sve_set() in ptrace.c is supposed to shift
the flags from header.flags (which is a u16) back into the
PR_SVE_SET_VL position (<< 16) for the flags argument of
sve_set_vector_length().  But this isn't done, so attempting to set (or
restore) those flags through ptrace may resulting EINVALs from
sve_set_vector_length().

I'll write a test for this case and implement a fix, something like...

-8<-

 static int sve_set(struct task_struct *target,
[...]
 	ret = sve_set_vector_length(target, header.vl,
-				    header.flags & ~SVE_PT_REGS_MASK);
+				    (header.flags & ~SVE_PT_REGS_MASK) << 16UL);


->8-

What do you think?

Again, I'll wait for your feedback first.
