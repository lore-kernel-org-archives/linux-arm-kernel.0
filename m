I think Marc said that he experimented with a similar patch once, but
that it caused corruption on the host side somehow.

Am I remembering correctly?  If so, we would need to make sure this
doesn't happen with this patch set...

Otherwise I think this sounds like a fairly good idea and I wonder if
the same could be done on arm64?
