Subject: [PATCH v2] coresight: moving to new "hwtracing" directory
Message-ID: <1426870883-12169-1-git-send-email-mathieu.poirier@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Keeping drivers related to HW tracing on ARM, i.e coresight,
under "drivers/coresight" doesn't make sense when other
architectures start rolling out technologies of the same
nature.

As such creating a new "drivers/hwtracing" directory where all
drivers of the same kind can reside, reducing namespace
pollution under "drivers/".
