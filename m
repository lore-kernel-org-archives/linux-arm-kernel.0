What I meant "read-only" is that debugger can't change it, while the program
itself can change it via prctl().

We only need such interface if it is useful, see more below.

Suppose it is useful to change vector length through ptrace, we should align
ptrace interface to prctl() as much as possible.  Looks that both prctl
change and ptrace change can go through sve_set_vector_length, easy to keep
two consistent.

Yes, gdb assumes the vector length may be changed, so it re-detects on
every stop, but I don't see the need for gdb to change the vector length.

Yes, these cases are valid, but the usefulness is still questionable to
me.  I just doubt that SVE developers do need to change vector length
when they are debugging code.  Note that it is not my strong objection
to this patch, if kernel people believe this is useful, I am fine with
it.
