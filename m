Thanks David. It helped a lot.

Hi Daniel,

Do you have any document to understand the working of tail calls? I
looked at your presentations but it seemed confusing to me. Anything
simple would be great, just about the tail calls. I don't think I need
examples, I can get them from your presentations. I just need a very
general idea. May be you know the code in kernel where it is
implemented.
Thanks for the help Daniel.

Best,
Shubham Bansal
