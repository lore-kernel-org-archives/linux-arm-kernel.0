In either case, we should make sure this is clear in the ABI.  I thought
that the "It does not necessarily indicate that the attribute can be
read or written in the device's current state." implied my
interpretation, but maybe I'm missing some subtlety there?

Do you think we should clarify the API?

By the way, I now realize that we are not maintining the same
understanding between get/set_attr, which I really think we should, so
I'll add the following:


diff --git a/virt/kvm/arm/pmu.c b/virt/kvm/arm/pmu.c
index 9b3e3ea..0cf62b7 100644
--- a/virt/kvm/arm/pmu.c
+++ b/virt/kvm/arm/pmu.c
@@ -551,6 +551,9 @@ int kvm_arm_pmu_v3_get_attr(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_device_attr *attr)
 		int __user *uaddr = (int __user *)(long)attr->addr;
 		int irq;
 
+		if (!irqchip_in_kernel(vcpu->kvm))
+			return -EINVAL;
+
 		if (!test_bit(KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3, vcpu->arch.features))
 			return -ENODEV;
 

I was only talking about has_attr above.

Let me know.

Thanks,
