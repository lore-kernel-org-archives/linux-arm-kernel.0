It really depends on what you mean by userspace (which benchmarks you
use). If for example you only care about Javascript heavy web
applications, all numbers are 64-bit floats. But I think it's worth
investigating.

We could also make it smarter and mark some tasks as FP heavy for a
limited time to avoid faults.
