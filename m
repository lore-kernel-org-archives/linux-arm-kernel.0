Yes, it's the output from "size -A vmlinux", with the lines dropped that
are unchanged. See the __bug_table above for the part that got dropped in
all but the first column. This is included in the "Total" row, but is
only 13% of the size difference, 32508 bytes for BUG_TABLE in
multi_v7_defconfig, compared to 139304 bytes difference in .text.
