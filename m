Ok. While uClibc still supports OABI, it seems rather unlikely that
there are active users of OABI uClibc that need any of the future
syscalls.

Ok. I'm sure it works, but we can definitely leave that for the
time when I or someone else gets around to do the same conversion
for ARM64 that you are doing for ARM32. From all I can tell, it's
a natural extension of the file you already have.

On x86, the motivation is faster code for most use cases that
don't need a lot of memory, as the 64-bit opcodes have 16 registers
rather than 8 in 32-bit mode but 32-bit pointers have lower
cache footprint than 64-bit pointers. 

Interestingly, while ARM64 is doing basically the same thing now,
the motivation is almost entirely different: going from around 16
to around 32 registers has a much lower impact on performance
than starting out with 8, but there are ARMv8 implementations that
lack aarch32 mode but still want to run legacy 32-bit code that
is too time-consuming to get 64-bit clean.

Well, if we don't need to worry about OABI any more, using a shared
file for all architectures to add new syscalls (with their compat
handlers) would also mean that you don't have to worry about the
compat handler either, since that gets added in the shared file
along with the syscall.

Then again, if we move the a shared file for new syscalls, we also
don't need to worry about synchronizing the syscall tables for
ARM and compat ARM64, since the files would not get changed any
more.
