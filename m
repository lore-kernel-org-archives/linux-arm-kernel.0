Subject: [PATCH 1/3] ARM: dts: r8a7790: consistently use single space before =
In-Reply-To: <20180126093635.16945-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
References: <20180126093635.16945-1-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
Message-ID: <20180126093635.16945-2-horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Consistently use a single space before a =.

This patch fixes instances where a tab is used instead.

This patch should not introduce any functional change.
