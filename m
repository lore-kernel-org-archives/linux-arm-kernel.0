so do we (e.g., fptr fixes for RAP, non-refcount atomic users, etc).

s/simplicity/minimality/ as the code itself can be complex but that'll be
of the minimal complexity we can come up with.

except that's not what happened at all. spender's first version did just
a vmalloc for the kstack like the totally NIH'd version upstream does
now. while we always anticipated buggy dma users and thus had code that
would detect them so that we could fix them, we quickly figured that the
upstream kernel wasn't quite up to snuff as we had assumed and faced with
the amount of buggy code, we went for the current vmap approach which
kept users' systems working instead of breaking them.

you're trying to imply that upstream fixed the drivers but as the facts
show, that's not true. you simply unleashed your code on the world and
hoped(?) that enough suckers would try it out during the -rc window. as
we all know several releases and almost a year later, that was a losing
bet as you still keep fixing those drivers (and something tells me that
we haven't seen the end of it). this is simply irresponsible engineering
for no technical reason.

i have yet to see anyone explain what they mean by 'leak' here but if it
is what i think it is then the arch specific entry/exit changes are not
optional but mandatory. see below for randomization.

you misunderstood, Daniel was talking about your use_mm approach.

what is the threat that a random address defends against?

the problem is that the amount of __read_only data extends beyond vmlinux,
i.e., this approach won't scale. another problem is that it can't be used
inside use_mm and switch_mm themselves (no read-only task structs or percpu
pgd for you ;) and probably several other contexts.

last but not least, use_mm says this about itself:

    (Note: this routine is intended to be called only
    from a kernel thread context)

so using it will need some engineering (or the comment be fixed).

you didn't address the arch-specific changes needed in the enter/exit paths.

based on my experience with UDEREF on amd64, unfortunately PCID isn't all
it's cracked up to be (IIRC, it maybe halved the UDEREF overhead instead of
basically eliminating it as i had anticipated, and that was on snb, ivb and
later do even worse).

what is the threat model you're assuming for this feature? based on what i
have for PaX (arbitrary read/write access exploited for data-only attacks),
the above makes no sense to me...
