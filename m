OK, so, fundamental linker design flaw that cannot be fixed for
historical reasons.  Gotcha.

This "fix" feels like a bit of a hack, since it relies on the absence of
a certain relocation type that could be added later (though it seems
highly unlikely).


Cleaner options would be to expose both symbols that are subtracted,
rather than the result, or to do the subtraction at build time and
generate a header that affected files include (though that's more
invasive on the Makefile side).

May be overkill though.

Fair enough.
