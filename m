I think we can ditch an isb or two:

Could you leave these to be synchronised by the isb() in __load_guest_stage2()?
An AT speculated here would see HCR_EL2.TGE set and use the EL2&EL0 regime.

Typo: stage-1?

stage2 remains disabled here, we only call __load_guest_stage2() for the vmid.
The problem was the EL1:stage-1 being usable and unknown when TGE is cleared.

__load_guest_stage2() already has an isb for this workaround after it writes
vtcr/vttbr. I think we can just refer to it in the comment and let it
synchronise the stage1+2 config before we touch hcr_el2 below.

Hmm, why do we need this isb?

We just set TGE, so these registers values no long matter. vcpu_put() would read
the values we wrote, as would __tlb_switch_to_guest_vhe() above if we re-ran
this sequence. If we're on our way into the guest, the extra isb in
__load_guest_stage2() would synchronise them before clearing TGE during
world-switch.

I don't think there is a path where we depend on these values being isb'd before
guest eret.

(if its just to be robust, I'm all in favour of it!)


Thanks,

James
