In the past we've had difficulties debugging things where we messed up
the stack because we couldn't get back to the normal world with no
reliable way to get the vcpu pointer.  That was the rationale for
storing the vcpu in a register as opposed to on the stack before.

We only recently changed that so that we could use tpidr_el2 to access
per-CPU variables.  Given that the vcpu pointer can already be found via
per-CPU variables, it makes sense to do that.

In terms of performance, your argument can be applied in isolation to
most patches in this series, and that was the initial approach I took in
the optimization work, only optimizing things that appeared significant
and would likely result in significant changes.  The results were
disappointing.  It was only when I included every micro-optimization for
the critical path that I could think of, that we were able to observe
order of magnitude improvements for some workloads.  Subsequent
measurements confirmed this, it was hard to measure individual benefits
from each patch, but overall the changes matter.

In that case, unless there's an argument that the code has become too
hard to understand, ...
