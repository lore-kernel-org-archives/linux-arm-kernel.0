Given that every __get_user() call now incurs the PAN switch overhead,
I wonder if it would be worth it to stash the real TTBR0_EL1 value in,
e.g., TPIDRRO_EL0 rather than load it from memory each time. We'd have
to reload the real value of TPIDRRO_EL0 at kernel exit every time, but
only for compat tasks, and not nearly as often, obviously.
