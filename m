Once I sent this, I realised what I said wasn't quite right.

It's true that FAR_EL1 is UNKNOWN in some cases, but today those are all
fatal (e.g. if we take an UNDEFINED exception due to a bad instruction
at EL1).

So my performance concern was spurious; sorry for the noise.

However, so as to not mis-report those fatal cases, we either need to
inspect the SP or ESR_EL1 to determine that FAR_EL1 is valid and/or this
was a stack-overflow

If we follow the approach of this series, we can move those checks into
the check_stack_ovf slow path.

Thanks,
Mark.
