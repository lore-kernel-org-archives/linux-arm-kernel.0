FYI: I applied these patches to 4.0 (only a trivial conflict on the x86
side) and this fixed an issue for me booting systems with mem=X,
reducing the amount of physical memory available on a system, which
would otherwise cause the system to just silently halt during boot.

Note that this seems to fix even more than it promises, because one of
those systems does not use an initrd, but I'm thinking maybe this fixes
issues with the DT as well?

In any case, I think this may be a good candidate for cc'ing to stable?

Thanks,
