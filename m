Any idea what this is ^ ?  I don't know if this is caused by me or you,
but I only seem to see it on subthreads you've replied to.

I'll take a look at that.  Inventing that here seemed a little ugly, and
this is all driven from the cpufreatures code anyway now which ensures a
certain ordering.

If I can reuse sys_caps_initialised for this, I will -- seems pointless
to reinvent it.
