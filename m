If we move patch 6 earlier, we could use pud_offset_kimg here, and avoid
the cast, at the cost of passing the pgd into fixmap_pud.

Similarly for fixmap_pmd.

I assume the return type change was unintentional?

With STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS:

arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c: In function 'fixmap_pmd':
arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c:604:9: warning: return from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
  return (CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS > 2) ? &bm_pmd[pmd_index(addr)]
         ^
arch/arm64/mm/mmu.c: In function 'early_fixmap_init':

      ^

       || pmd != fixmap_pmd(fix_to_virt(FIX_BTMAP_END))) {
              ^

Side note: is there any reason we can't/shouldn't make
STRICT_MM_TYPECHECKS a common config option? Or simply have it on by
default for arm64?

Having built with and without typechecks I see that it doesn't bloat the
kernel Image size, though the binary isn't quite identical:

[mark at leverpostej:~/src/linux]% ls -al *.*checks
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mark mark   9288192 Jan 11 15:40 Image.checks
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mark mark   9288192 Jan 11 15:36 Image.nochecks
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mark mark 106782024 Jan 11 15:40 vmlinux.checks
-rwxrwxr-x 1 mark mark 106688928 Jan 11 15:35 vmlinux.nochecks

Things didn't quite line up between the two images, though I'm not sure
what the underlying difference was.

Thanks,
Mark.
