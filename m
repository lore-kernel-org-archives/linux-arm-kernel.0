Hi James,
   Sorry for my late response due to out of office recently.

yes, I agree, it is policy choice.

thanks for the explanation.
For the ESR_ELx_AET_UER, this exception is precise, closing the VM may
be better[1].
But if you think panic is better until we support kernel-first, it is
also OK to me.

In fact, if we have kernel-first, I think we still need to judge the
error type by ESR, right?
If the handle_guest_sei() , may be the system does not support firmware-first,
so we judge the ESR value,
