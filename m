This part I understood, but I somehow had the impression that
HYP_PAGE_OFFSET_MASK could mask off more than (63 - VA_BITS + 1) bits,
but looking at the definition of HYP_PAGE_OFFSET_MASK it clearly cannot.

What can I say, I probably shouldn't have looked at code yesterday.

If we can, that would be good.
