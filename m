I was thinking one global unless more are needed for some reason.

I read this as: the CPU still semantically tags global TLB entries
with a PCID, but the CPU will use (probably) use those TLB entries
even if the PCIDs don't match.  IIRC none of the TLB instructions have
any effect that makes the PCID associated with a global entry visible,
so the CPU could presumably omit the PCID tags entirely for global
entries.  E.g. I don't think there's any way to say "flush global
entries with a given PCID".
