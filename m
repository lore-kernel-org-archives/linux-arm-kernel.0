nds32 was obsolete even at the time of merging (it's just that Andes have
a novel idea of actually supporting their old product lines!), thus it'll
be a short lived port.  It doesn't matter much if it carries legacy baggage
-- especially that it has existing out-of-mainline users.

Not so much for riscv32, which is designed and planned to be very long
lived.  And has no existing _Linux_ users.

While modern userland tends to implement LFS support, it's still opt in for
individual binaries at compile time.  With my (userland) porter hat on, I
can tell you that no matter how you preach about using sane build systems, a
terrifying portion of packages manage to fail to pass such flags.
Especially for lesser-known or new architectures -- you need to specifically
add the flag for every new arch for every such piece of software.

Its lack is also not so easy to spot in an automated way; an experimental
and hacky attempt to detect them (IIRC by checking whether the program in
question imports an open/lseek/etc symbol instead of open64) is here:
  https://lintian.debian.org/tags/binary-file-built-without-LFS-support.html
20511 ELFs in 5953 packages!

If there's no 32-bit open() (ie, it's an alias to open64()), all these bugs
are immediately fixed.  Well, a program can still store file size in an int,
but at least there's no interface problem.


On the kernel side, you avoid the need to carry syscalls and structs for
32-bit variants.  This gets you less complexity and a smaller kernel.
