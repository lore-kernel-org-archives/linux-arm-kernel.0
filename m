Subject: [PATCH] arm: zynq: Use C pre-processor for includes in dts
Message-ID: <8ae3984fe87ab188b5616c63d6ebe66603f030db.1500557621.git.michal.simek@xilinx.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Change the dtsi include code to use the C pre-processor #include instead
of the device tree /include/. This brings all Zynq device trees inline
with each other.
