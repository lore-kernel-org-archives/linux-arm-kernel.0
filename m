Yes, we just pick up the compiler's __BIG_ENDIAN__ if specified.

I must be confused here, but I don't see that these do anything different.

If we are writing 32 bits to to->si_ptr or to->si_int, either way the high 32 bits
are irrelevant.  So whether we read it from from->si_ptr and massage the high bits,
or just read it from from->si_int as a straight-up 32-bit quantity, either way it
seems we should end up writing the same bits to userspace.

I would understand the argument if we were overlaying the si_ptr/si_int union
from a kernel-side siginfo_t where si_ptr and si_int are different sizes
onto userspace, but it doesn't seem we ever do that.

All that said, it certainly seems like the si_int version is simpler, so I don't have
a problem with switching to it, but I don't see how it fixes a problem.
