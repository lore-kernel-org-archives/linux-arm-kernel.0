Hmmm, on reflection I think we still have the same underlying problem
here, which is that pulling fpsimd save/restore outside the
local_irq_disable() region exposes us to softirqs that can trash the
state.  Long-term blocking of softirq or kernel-mode NEON could fix
this, but the impact on kernel-mode NEON client code would probably
be unacceptable (recalling discussions we had with Ard).

I don't see a straightforward way around this that doesn't involve
adding logic in the kvm run/loop and fpsimd hyp trap code...
