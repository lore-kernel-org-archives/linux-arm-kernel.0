Subject: [PATCH v2 0/7] arm64: Privileged Access Never using TTBR0_EL1
 switching
Message-ID: <1472828533-28197-1-git-send-email-catalin.marinas@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This is the second version of the arm64 PAN emulation by disabling
TTBR0_EL1 accesses. The major change from v1 is the use of a thread_info
member to store the real TTBR0_EL1 value. The advantage is slightly
simpler assembler macros for uaccess_enable with the downside that
switch_mm() must always update the saved ttbr0 even if there is no mm
switch.

Whether we could simplify these patches further to use some TCR_EL1.EPD0
tricks remains to be confirmed with the ARM architects. However, it is
unlikely that they would deem such idea architecturally safe, hence this
series only switches TTBR0_EL1 in accordance with the ARM ARM.

Changes since v1:

- Using thread_info instead of per-CPU variable for the real TTBR0_EL1
  value (mentioned above)

- Factored out the cpu_do_switch_mm errata workaround to a separate
  macro and avoided the "errata" argument to the uaccess_enable asm
  macro

- Fix build error with allnoconfig by moving the uaccess_* asm macros to
  asm/uaccess.h and avoid some cyclic header includes

- _PSR_PAN_BIT moved to the non-uapi ptrace.h

- Use x21 instead of lr as temporary register in entry.S

As per v1, the code requires more testing, especially for combinations
where hardware PAN and/or UAO are present.

The patches are also available on this branch:

Thanks for reviewing/testing.
