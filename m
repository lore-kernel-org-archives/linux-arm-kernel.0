In practise this will never happen, because the only caller
(handle_mapi) takes the its_lock mutex. But I see that this is fragile
and not safe. I guess I can search the list again after having taken the
lock.

Argh, good catch!

Possibly, I don't like it either. Let me check if I can kill that sucker.
