Subject: [PATCH 0/6] Update Kona drivers to use clocks
Message-ID: <1380831194-27238-1-git-send-email-tim.kryger@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

This series declares the clocks present on bcm11351 (aka bcm281xx) SoCs
to be fixed at the rates configured by development bootloaders and then
updates the Kona drivers to make use of clock calls where appropriate.

This patch series depends on the following three commits being present:
