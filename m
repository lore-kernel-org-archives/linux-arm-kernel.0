Why do we need to treat this case as a permission fault? It looks like a
fault that wasn't a deliberate uaccess (which thus doesn't have a fixup
handler) should have do_page_fault call __do_kernel_fault, where we
should die().

Is this just for more consistent reporting of erroneous accesses to user
memory? Or does this fix some other issue?

This sounds fine, though it might be better as a separate/preparatory
patch.

Since the entry code will clear the PAN bit in the SPSR when we see the
reserved ASID, faults in EFI runtime services will still be correctly
reported, though that's somewhat subtle (and it took me a while to
convince myself that was the case).

Also, I think that faults elsewhere may be misreported, e.g. in cold
entry to kernel paths (idle, hotplug) where we have a global mapping in
TTBR0, and it looks like we're using the reserved ASID.

I'm not immediately sure how to distinguish those cases.

Thanks,
Mark.
