First of all, sorry for delay ;)

So far I quickly glanced at this series and everything look fine, but
I am confused by the signal_group_exit() check,

Probably this connects to that check below? I can't understand this...

-EINVAL looks a bit confusing in this case, but this is cosemtic because
userspace won't see this error-code anyway.

OK, this doesn't hurt, but why?

You could check __fatal_signal_pending() with the same effect. And since
we hold this mutex, exec (de_thread) can be the source of that SIGKILL.
We take this mutex specially to avoid the race with exec.

So why do we need to abort if we race with kill() or exit_grouo() ?

Oleg.
