When I mentioned it, I didn't realise that we already use 6 registers
for mmap(). While we can go up to 8 on AArch64/ILP32, I think Arnd has a
point that we don't want this to diverge from other new 32-bit
architectures. I don't really have a strong opinion either way here,
just a remark that AArch64/ILP32 already diverged from _current_ 32-bit
architectures by introducing 64-bit off_t in a 32-bit world. Introducing
an mmap64() at the same time wouldn't look too bad either.

I thought ILP32 will use llseek() which has its own explicit way of
passing a 64-bit offset and the result written back by the kernel. We
wouldn't be able to use lseek() because of the return type.

We've discussed this a few times already and the only sane option from
the _kernel_ perspective seemed to be either (a) close to native ABI for
ILP32 (and breaking POSIX) or (b) just a standard 32-bit ABI. The latter
implies splitting 64-bit values in register pairs, especially to avoid a
lot of annotations/wrapping in the generic kernel unistd.h file. IIRC,
we decided to go with option (b), so I don't think it's worth re-opening
that discussion.

It's more like the user wanting a quick transition from code that was
only ever compiled for AArch32 (or other 32-bit architecture) with a
goal of full LP64 transition on the long run. I have yet to see
convincing benchmarks showing ILP32 as an advantage over LP64 (of
course, I hear the argument of reading a pointer a loop is twice as fast
with a half-size pointer but I don't consider such benchmarks relevant).
