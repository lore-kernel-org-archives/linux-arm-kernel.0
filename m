I think the two implementations should be similar in that sense.
Differences like this in sych symmetric code tend to be confusing later
on.

ah, I was thinking of this function as dealing with EOI interrupts only,
but you're right.  The confusing part though is that this bit is cleared
regardless of whether or not there was a maintenance interrupt.

So, it's up to you.

That's fine.  You're probably a better judge of this having fiddled
around with the code so much.  If it feels cleaner to you to keep them
separate for now, let's do that, and we can play with a cleanup later if
we feel like it.

That's fine, but can we tweak the comment then, because I still don't
understand the bit about what the guest expects vs. IRQs and FIQs.

If the guest programs an interrupt to Group0, wouldn't it expect to see
an FIQ, but even in this case we inject it as IRQs?  Maybe there's some
complexity here that I don't see.

I would phrase it something like:

/*
 * We don't support grouping yet and therefore hard code all interrupts
 * to be Group1 interrupts and signal IRQs (not FIQs) to the guest.
 */

But as I said, maybe I'm not getting it.
