We could use SMC calls here a well, as the "conduit" as I believe the
ARM folks are calling it.  We just need to agree somewhere (across
hypervisors preferably), that when you have virtual EL2, everything is
via SMC (even upcalls to a host hypervisor), and otherwise it's via HVC.

Yes, and the KVM support follows this patch in the series as it turns
out (but given the time since I looked at this series last, I forgot).
