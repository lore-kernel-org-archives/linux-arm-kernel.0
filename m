I doubt it. The EDK2 bug resulted in no interrupt being delivered due to
the group being set to 1, and the interrupt being acknowledged through
the Group0 accessor. Also, this was a 32bit special, and 64bit EDK2 was
just fine.

What Peng describes here is the guest writing the group as 0, which
doesn't make much sense (I certainly don't see EDK2 doing that).

Thanks,
