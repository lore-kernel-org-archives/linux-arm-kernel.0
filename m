Subject: [PATCH 4/4] ARM: dts: imx6sl: Fix memory node duplicaton
In-Reply-To: <1542729585-9330-1-git-send-email-festevam@gmail.com>
References: <1542729585-9330-1-git-send-email-festevam@gmail.com>
Message-ID: <1542729585-9330-4-git-send-email-festevam@gmail.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Boards based on imx6sl have duplicate memory nodes:

- One coming from the board dts file: memory@

- One coming from the imx6sl.dtsi file.

Fix the duplication by removing the memory node from the dtsi file
and by adding 'device_type = "memory";' in the board dts.
