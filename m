I'm not really asking for changes.

I'm basically asking for the commit message to do a better job of
explaining this - in years to come, the currently proposed commit
message contains very little information about why this commit exists.

Commit messages need to say what they're doing and why, and not assume
that someone's been to some conference and knows all the inside details
that were discussed there.  It's also best to avoid referencing papers -
conferences and their websites come and go, and links break, at which
point information gets lost.  If it's all properly explained in the
commit message, then it's there forever.
