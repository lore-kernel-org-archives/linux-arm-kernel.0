Subject: [PATCH v5 03/13] arm64: cpufeature: Detect CPU RAS Extentions
In-Reply-To: <20171215155101.23505-1-james.morse@arm.com>

From: Xie XiuQi <xiexiuqi@huawei.com>

ARM's v8.2 Extentions add support for Reliability, Availability and
Serviceability (RAS). On CPUs with these extensions system software
can use additional barriers to isolate errors and determine if faults
are pending. Add cpufeature detection.

Platform level RAS support may require additional firmware support.

+
+	  Selecting this feature will allow the kernel to use these barriers
+	  and access the new registers if the system supports the extension.
+	  Platform RAS features may additionally depend on firmware support.
