Indeed.  And I wondered if we should just nuke this file.  The reason I
added it originally was that the concept of "never taking the interrupt"
was confusing to most, and we had to explain it several times over, but
perhaps it's really not needed anymore and we should let people read the
code instead?

No, you're right, it' crap.

Right again.
