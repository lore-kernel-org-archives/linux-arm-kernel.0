(So this is guaranteed on 32bit? I thought this was because 32bit uses the
kernel-VA's at HYP, so any way the compiler generates the address will work.)

Why does this need to be volatile? I see gcc v4.9 generate this sequence twice
in __vgic_v2_save_state(). Can't it cache and reorder this sequence as it likes?

Either-way:

(I had a go at using 'Ush', to let the compiler schedule the adrp, but couldn't
get it to work.)

Thanks,
