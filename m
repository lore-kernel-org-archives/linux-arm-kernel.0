We've seen noticeable performance improvement with the microbench workloads,
ans also some of our customers have observed improvements on heavy workloads. 
Unfortunately I can't share those specific results here. SMCCC call overhead 
is much higher as compared to link stack workaround on Falkor, ~99X.

Host kernel workaround takes less than ~20 CPU cycles, whereas SMCCC_ARCH_WOKAROUND_1
consumes thousands of CPU cycles to sanitize the branch prediction on Falkor.  

Especially workloads inside virtual machines provides much better results because
no KVM involvement is required whenever guest calls qcom_link_stack_sanitization().
