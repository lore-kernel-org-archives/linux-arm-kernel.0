Yes, that also works for my case.

Hah, good catch!  The double-click-to-copy behavior is kind of flakey
on RHEL 6's default terminal, and I bet that bit me.  It's 41099f4e.

Well, the firmware clearly does this intentionally.  In ATF's
drivers/arm/giv/arm_gic.c, the gicv3_cpuif_setup() function has
a comment that reads:

/*******************************************************************************
  * This function does some minimal GICv3 configuration. The Firmware itself does
  * not fully support GICv3 at this time and relies on GICv2 emulation as
  * provided by GICv3. This function allows software (like Linux) in later stages
  * to use full GICv3 features.
  ******************************************************************************/

and the function ends with:

	val = read_icc_sre_el3();
	write_icc_sre_el3(val | ICC_SRE_EN | ICC_SRE_SRE);

In our build environment, if I comment out those two lines, that
fixes the guest boot problem (without any hacking on the Linux side),
so that's good anyway.  With this change it works for me in the
Fast Models as well as Foundation Models, too.
