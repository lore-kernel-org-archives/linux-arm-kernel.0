Nothing. They are gone. What is left at the CPU interface is the active
priority.

Your architecture document has a section 1.2.1 which contains the
sentence: "LPIs do not have an active state, and therefore do not
require explicit deactivation.". It also has 1.2.2 ("Interrupt states")
that repeatedly states the same thing. Finally, the email you quote is
about priority drop vs deactivation, not about the active state of an
LPI.

Or not. Read again. The only case where something vaguely relevant
happens is when you inject a virtual SPI backed by a HW LPI. In that
case, the LR does have an active state (of course, this is an SPI). Or
when you inject a virtual LPI backed by a HW SPI (in which case the
relevant active state is in the physical distributor, not in the LR).

I'd appreciate if you could try to read and understand the architecture
spec instead of randomly googling and quoting various bits of
irrelevant information.

If something is unclear in the architecture specification (yes, this
is complicated and sometimes confusing), please ask relevant questions.
At the moment, you're just asserting fallacies, and I'd rather spend
time doing something useful instead of setting the record straight
again and again.

Thanks,

	M.
