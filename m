this should be for a non-VHE guest hypervisor, or a guest hypervisor
which doesn't set the E2H bit.

Similarly here, it's not about the architecture level (you can have
kernels that er v8.3 aware as both the host and guest and run on v8.3
hardware, but still both of these cases are relevant.

So this part could become:

		/*

		 * virtual memory control registers directly.
		 */

I don't actually understand why we want to respect the HCR_TVM and
HCR_TRVM bits when running in vEL2 ?  Isn't that only if the VM runs in
EL0 in the hyp context ?

There are also some style issues here, I would prefer:

		if (foo) {
			/* Foo */
			foo();
		} else {
			/* Bar */
			bar();
		}
