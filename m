The reason people started to do this is to stop a security leak in the
ALSA code: ALSA allocates the ring buffer with dma_alloc_coherent()
which used to grab pages and return them uninitialised.  These pages
could contain anything - including the contents of /etc/shadow, or
your bank details.

ALSA then lets userspace mmap() that memory, which means any user process
which has access to the sound devices can read data leaked from kernel
memory.

I think I did bring it up at the time I found it, and decided that the
safest thing to do was to always return an initialised buffer - short of
constantly auditing every dma_alloc_coherent() user which also mmap()s
the buffer into userspace, I couldn't convince myself that it was safe
to avoid initialising the buffer.

I don't know whether the original problem still exists in ALSA or not,
but I do know that there are dma_alloc_coherent() implementations out
there which do not initialise prior to returning memory.

This is likely to be slow in the case of non-cached memory and large
allocations.  The config option should come with a warning.
