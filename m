Yeah, it was something that Catalin suggested too. I guess the only
thing that really annoys me about that is that we'd let the callback do
the write to the kernel text, which I find a bit... meh.

But overall I agree that it would be more useful, and make the loop a
bit less ugly.

I'll work something out for the next round!

Thanks,
