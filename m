At the moment migration from B to C will fail because source ABI rev =
v2 > destination support ABI = v1.

A (v1) -> B (v1 & v2): migration OK
B (v1 & v2) -> C (v1): migration NOK

What could be done if we want something clever is source KVM detects
which ABI is sufficient and choose the lowest revision for the save. for
instance if no vLPI choose rev1, otherwise rev2. rev2 typically is
needed for vLPI support for nested as we need to save/restore vPE table
and vLPIs in ITE (2x8 byte entries).

The problem is that once you have migrated to B and you start playing
with vLPIs and C do not know the table layout for vPE/vLPIs, you can't
migrate anymore.
