This series patch is separated from https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg168917.html

1. Detect whether KVM can set set guest SError syndrome
2. Support to Set VSESR_EL2 and inject SError by user space.
3. Support live migration to keep SError pending state and VSESR_EL2 value

The user space patch is here: https://www.mail-archive.com/qemu-devel at nongnu.org/msg539534.html
BTW: The user space patch is needed to rebase
