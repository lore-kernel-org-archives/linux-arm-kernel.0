Which makes it hard to understand for everyone. If you want something
truly generic, assign proper names to these defines:

#define CBASER_ARCHITECTURAL_PA_BITS	52
#define CBASER_IMPLEMENTATION_PA_BITS	48

and repaint all your defines to use macros along those lines. If not,
just change everything to 48 and let's be done with it.
