Subject: [PATCH v2 00/11] Fixes to v7 of the vITS save/restore series
Message-ID: <20170509085618.28311-1-cdall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

We spotted a number of isses on the v7 ITS save/restore patch series,
but because most of that patch series is in really good shape, and
because the work discussed is somewhat orthogonal (the register iodevs
in particular), I decided to send out a set of fixes to apply after the
main ITS save/restore series, and we can apply the v7 series plus these
fixes.

The whole series with the fixes applied on top of queue can be found here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cdall/linux.git its-save-restore-queue-fixes-v2

Thanks,
-Christoffer

Changes since v1:
 - We got rid of the requirement to initialize the ITS (it doesn't do
   anything).
 - We fixed a race condition with setting the ITS base address which was
   introduced in v1 of this series.
 - We reworded some commit messages based on Eric's comments
 - We fixed the address check to work with partically unset base addrs
 - We use the vcpu index instead of the vcpu id for allocating redist
   regions.
 - Some renames and code cleanups.
