Do you have plans to do so? If so can you elaborate on such plans ?

The thing is the semantics even for write-combining need to be discussed
further, write-combining for kernel interfaces are screwed up for at least one
architecture becaues we didn't get things right or document expectations
correctly amongst other things, so the above is not sufficient to define
write-combining for now.

Yes but we have ioremap_nocache(). I added ioremap_uc() and the goal behind ioremap_uc()
was to enable efficient use of absolutely no cache at all, and this was particularly
aimed at taking advantage of strong UC on PAT. This was also a compromise to help
with the transition over on x86 from UC- to UC in the long term as we also convert
all write-combining variant API users to (old mtrr_add(), now arch_phys_wc_add())
over from ioremap_nocache() to ioremap_wc() and ensure its MMIO registers use
keep using ioremap_nocache() -- but for corner cases with old MTRR hacks we need
ioremap_uc() to also avoid regressions when we do the flip on x86 fromr UC- to
UC. How we want to map this to other architectures remaisn to be discovered, but
perhaps they don't care.

Anyway so why is WB and WT allowed if you are going to remove WC and not add UC?

It can be if you are not doing a major long term cleanup...

Then what API was it you intend on using for that ? My point is that semantics
shoudl matter then for that -- strongly.

arch_phys_wc_add(), set_memory_wc(), set_memory_*(). There may be others. The
mem region API Toshi just fixed is another.

Like I said we need to take care to ensure EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() is not used
then by new wrappers to enable proprietary drivers to make use of those
symbosl through the new wrapper. One idea may be to work on symbol namespaces,
if we cannot address this through static inlines for old callers and just
making the new APIs EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL().
