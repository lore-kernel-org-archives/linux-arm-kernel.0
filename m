almost, but this is not the case for the timer, where we set the active
state manually, I'll attempt a reword.

I'm talking about any level-triggered interrupt where you handle the
interrupt in the guest.  In that case, if you keep deactivating the
interrupt on the host the guest will never make progress.

This is not specific to the timer I think?

Yes, the physical IRQ can be pending+active, but the key is that the
host doesn't deactivate the IRQ.

well you restore the timer state at the same time, so you setup the
hardware exactly as if the timer device raised a physical interrupt
while running the VM.  (in fact that's why we set the active state as
well, because we re-program the arch-timer to assert the line when we
enter the guest).

I was deliberately going for a broader definition; generally trying to
describe how we deal with interrupts from a physical device handled by a
guest, which we do by letting the guest deactive the interrupt.  I think
this is the correct causality analysis ... ?

I agree that the flow feels a bit ad-hoc here.  I'll try to rework the
doc.

I'll try to clarify this as well.

indeed, I'll reword.
