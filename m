Would it make sense to also randomize the pa-to-va mapping on top of this?
That can certainly be a later follow-up, I'm just trying to think of the options
we have, given that the kernel is now relocatable and we can support arbitrary
pa-to-va mappings already.

Can you explain how the random seed is passed from the bootloader
to the kernel when we don't use EFI? Is this implemented at all? I see
that you add a seed to "/chosen/kaslr-seed" in the EFI stub when using
the EFI boot services, but I don't see where that value gets read again
when we relocate the kernel.
