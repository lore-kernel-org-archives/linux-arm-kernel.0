There are not many headers in uapi which require additional userspace
headers to compile (I'm not saying that uapi headers represent the full
API's/ABI's, it's clear they don't). If there are ~700 headers and just a
single one needs an exception and additional dependencies, I would try to
make it work without the dependency. I just need some advice and guidance
from maintainers how to do this.

Or we should start tracking these userspace library dependencies too,
at least at linux-headers package levels in distributions. This might
be a good idea anyway, but then we might as well move headers like this
directly to the userspace library and out of include/uapi.

Both would solve the non-compiling uapi header problem.

Understood.
