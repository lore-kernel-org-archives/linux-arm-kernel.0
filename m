You can already have a 32 bit gdb that is able to do remote debugging of
64 bit processes using a gdb server process. I guess it wouldn't be
too strange to have a ptrace extension to allow the native case as well.
I agree it's not a high priority.

Better ask the gdb folks. I'm adding Uli to Cc, maybe he has some insight.
