hmm, reading this, I'm remembering that the rationale was that the
pending state is maintained in the hardware so we never need to resample
any software state.  If the interrupt hits again (injected from VFIO for
example) it must have not been pending, otherwise we have a bug.

Is this the right way to look at it?

I think this needs to be documented somewhere in the code.

right, like I said above.  We need to document this; it's not trivial.

I would fold it into validate and clearly comment that function so that
it's clear what it does.
