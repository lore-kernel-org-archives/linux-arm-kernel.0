The architecture is massively ambiguous about what is actually required
in terms of CMOs when using an uncached mapping (and whether you can hit
in the cache or not).

But even if the guest had done an invalidate in order not to hit in the
cache, the host could have evicted the page to disk, the guest faulted
the page back in, and it would still be the host's responsibility to
ensure that the guest sees something consistent.

No worries, I'm always happy to revisit this particular rabbit hole... ;-)

Thanks,
