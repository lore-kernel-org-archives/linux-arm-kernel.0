Subject: [PATCH 27/29] arm64: Force KPTI to be disabled on Cavium ThunderX

commit 6dc52b15c4a4 upstream.

Cavium ThunderX's erratum 27456 results in a corruption of icache
entries that are loaded from memory that is mapped as non-global
(i.e. ASID-tagged).

As KPTI is based on memory being mapped non-global, let's prevent
it from kicking in if this erratum is detected.
