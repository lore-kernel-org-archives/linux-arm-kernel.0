Subject: [PATCH 13/35] arm64: dts: r8a7796: Add external audio clocks
In-Reply-To: <cover.1495457812.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>

Message-ID: <bab732f84aac51b00399ce63bf76d0b5241e4051.1495457812.git.horms+renesas@verge.net.au>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert+renesas@glider.be>

Add the external audio clocks as zero Hz fixed-frequency clocks.
Boards that provide these clocks should override them.

Based on commit 623197b90c7aa97c ("arm64: renesas: r8a7795: Sound SSI
PIO support").
