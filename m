Subject: [PATCH v3 0/5] Handle forwarded level-triggered interrupts
Message-ID: <20170906122612.18050-1-cdall@linaro.org>

This series illustrates an alternative approach to Eric Auger's direct EOI
setup patches [1] in terms of the KVM VGIC support.

The idea is to maintain existing semantics for the VGIC for mapped
level-triggered IRQs and think support for the timer into it.

Patch 1 is necessary to align the timer and VFIO ways of signaling the
VGIC.  Patch 2 is stolen from Eric's series and is necessary for these
patches to compile as well.  Patch 3 includes the core support for
mapped level-triggered interrupts.  Patch 4 handles guest MMIO access to
the virtual distributor.  Patch 5 moves some code around for patch 6.
Patch 6 implements an optimization for the timer.  The last two patches
could be deferred until the timer optimization series.

Based on v4.13

Changes since v2:
 - Removed patch 5 from v2 and integrating the changes in what's now
   patch 5 to make it easier to reuse code when adding VFIO integration.
 - Changed the virtual distributor MMIO handling to use the
   pending_latch and more closely match the semantics of SPENDR and
   CPENDR for both level and edge mapped interrupts.

Changes since v1:
 - Added necessary changes to the timer (Patch 1)
 - Added handling of guest MMIO accesses to the virtual distributor
   (Patch 4)
 - Addressed Marc's comments from the initial RFC (mostly renames)

Thanks,
-Christoffer
