Someone complained once about adding too many arch ioctls because there
is a limited number space for doing so, but I'm not sure if that was and
still a valid concern.

It is customary to expose features via capabilities.  I have a vague
recollection that tools like libvirt negotiate capabilities across
systems and would need more plumbing to discover features by probing an
ioctl instead.
