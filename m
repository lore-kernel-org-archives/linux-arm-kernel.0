I see, thanks for explaining.

This means the initialization in kvm_vgic_vcpu_init depends on whether 
userland creates the GIC device first or the vcpus first...

I don't think the issue lies in vgic_v3_populate_lr, but in 
kvm_vgic_vcpu_init which clearly expects dist->vgic_model to be 
initialized in two places. However, the comment at the top of 
vgic-init.c states:

  * CPU Interface: 
 
 

  * 
 
 

  * - kvm_vgic_vcpu_init(): initialization of static data that 
 
 

  *   doesn't depend on any sizing information or emulation type. No 
 
 

  *   allocation is allowed there.

So I don't think we're supposed to check for dist->vgic_model here. 
Those two checks should probably be moved elsewhere (maybe in 
kvm_vgic_vcpu_enable?) once the gic type has been set.

Thanks,
