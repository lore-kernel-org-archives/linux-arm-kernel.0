Thanks for rebasing the series!

Just a heads up that I may not be able to review this series for the
next 1-2 weeks, so I'm afraid it's not going to make it in for v4.4,
sorry.

Please let me know if this breaks expectations from everyone.

Othersie, I will try review it with due dilligence so it makes it in for
v4.5.

Best,
-Christoffer
