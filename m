I accept that it can be quite confusing. Once we get level independent types
and table accessors this might be easier. For now, the general rule is stick
to stage2_ accessors whenever you deal with the stage2 table. Rest should be
left to the stage2 code to deal with it.

Yep, that looks fine to me.
