If CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE is selected then the kernel has the code to send
SIGBUS_MCCERR_A* signals to user space.
This can be triggered by any GHES. A case in point: the 'AMD Seattle Overdrive'
under my desk has a HEST with four polled GHES entries. If any of these generate
a memory error the kernel will trigger the memory_failure() code.

Without all the ACPI stuff we still have CONFIG_HWPOISON_INJECT,
madvise(MADV_HWPOISON).
sysfs's: 'soft_offline_page' and 'hard_offline_page' as mechanisms that may
trigger memory_failure().

User space shouldn't try and guess whether its likely to get one of these.

I've been using these mechanisms to test SDEI virtualisation with kvmtool.

You've switched from talking about the CPU's 'ARM v8.2 RAS extensions' to 'RAS'.
Supporting memory_failure() is a linux:RAS feature, it doesn't depend on the
cpu:'ARM v8.2 RAS extensions'.

Which component doesn't have RAS? The CPU? Okay, what about the memory controller:
The memory controller may catch a parity error during dram refresh/scrub, and
signal firmware via an interrupt. Firmware can then read the affected address
from the memory-controller's error registers and report it to the OS as a
firmware-first error.
The CPU doesn't need any RAS features for this to work.

To caricature your argument: 'the CPU doesn't have this particular version of
this particular RAS feature, thus no component in the system has any RAS feature'.

APEI's firmware-first is an abstraction so that we don't need to know which
system components have RAS features (or how to drive them) , we let firmware do
the work and tell us the results.

~s/APEI/CPER/

I agree the main path into memory_failure() is from APEI, and we get the address
from the CPER records. This isn't the only path into memory_failure, and there
may be more in the future.
None of the firmware-first stuff depends on CPU RAS features, it may be
reporting errors from some other component in the system.

Back to the issue at hand: should qemu/kvmtool generate a HEST?
If these tools want to inject emulated errors into a guest: yes. (this may be
totally independent of what the host supports)
If these tools want to pass memory-failure notifications for guest-memory into a
guest: yes.
You may want to make this depend on whether the host supports memory-failure
notifications, but you  shouldn't care where they come from.

Does the host support memory-failure notifications?
You can poke around in /proc to find this out, /proc/sys/vm has:
> memory_failure_early_kill
> memory_failure_recovery
when the kernel was built with CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE, but it user-space has
support for this stuff I don't know why you wouldn't unconditionally turn it on.
(what happens if you migrate between hosts with different support...)
