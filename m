Subject: [PATCH v4 00/28] arm/arm64: KVM: Rework the hyp-stub API
Message-ID: <20170321192058.9300-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

As noticed by RMK in this thread[1], the hyp-stub API on 32bit ARM
could do with some TLC (it cannot perform a soft-restart at HYP, and
has holes in the hyp-stub support in a number of places). In general,
it would be desirable for the 32bit behaviour to align on 64bit, if
only to ease maintenance.

This series implements the following:
- Add HVC_[GS]ET_VECTORS and HVC_SOFT_RESTART to the 32bit code
- Add HVC_RESET_VECTORS to both arm and arm64, removing the need for
  __hyp_reset_vectors
- Implement add the stub entry points in the KVM init code, which
  didn't implement any so far
- Convert the HYP code to use the init code stubs directly
- Some general cleanup as a result of these changes (which includes
  killing HVC_GET_VECTORS)
- Add some API documentation that covers the above

Patches 12 to 14 would be better squashed into 10 and 11, but I've
kept them separate so that I can take the blame for everything I've
broken.

I've tested this on arm (Cubietruck, Jetson TK1) and arm64 (Seattle),
both as host and guest. Keerthy has been kind enough to test the 32bit
code on DRA7-EVM, AM57XX-EVM and KEYSTONE-K2E-EVM.

* From v3:
  - Reworked the way we save/restore lr on arm64, making it EL2's job
  in a consistent way (these are the three initial patches)
  - Collected RBs, TBs and Acks from James, Keerthy and Russell
  - Rebased on 4.11-rc3

* From v2:
  - Kill HVC_GET_VECTORS and the corresponding __hyp_get_vectors

* From v1:
  - Fixed some glaring bugs (reported by Ard and James)
  - Tidy up stub vector export on 32bit (Ard)
  - Nicer VA/PA conversion on 32bit (Ard)
  - Updated cpu_v7_reset documentation
  - Cleaned up HYP reset on PM events
  - Minor stub documentation update
