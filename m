When the code is properly reviewed and nobody raises relevant
objections, the maintainers of the subsystem can merge the code.

You're missing a key point.  If the system can reasonably recover from a
failure or some condition, it's definitely preferred to use a print or a
warning.

However, if an internal function is called with an unsupported value,
when managing the operation of hardware, the most sane thing to do is to
panic, because the system is in an enitrely unsupported state.

Seriously, what make you think I need a programming lesson from you?

You are taking a specific lesson and generalizing it, and then applying
it to a piece of code you admit to not understanding.  This is not
helpful.

I really don't care about your nasty feelings at this point, and
claiming that calling the same function twice is in general a problem is
a ridiculous statement.

I think I've answered this already, but that's because this function
will eventually become:

bool kvm_arch_timer_get_input_level(int vintid)
{
	struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu = kvm_arm_get_running_vcpu();
	struct arch_timer_context *timer;

	if (vintid == vcpu_vtimer(vcpu)->irq.irq)
		timer = vcpu_vtimer(vcpu);
	else
		timer = vcpu_ptimer(vcpu);

	if (timer->loaded)
		__timer_snapshot_state(timer);

	return kvm_timer_should_fire(timer);
}

If you don't understand what KVM is and how to use it, I'm afraid your
input is not very valuable.

Until you change your attitude and make some attempt to understand how
we work, and try to actually understand the code you comment on, I'll be
inclined to ignore future posting from you.
