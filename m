I think it should be adapted (if need be) and adopted for sparc, power
and others, especially as it will result in a reduction in code size
and make future alterations to gup easier.
I would prefer to get this in iteratively; and have people who are
knowledgeable of those architectures and have a means of testing the
code thoroughly to help out. (it will be very hard for me to implement
this on my own, but likely trivial for people who know and can test
those architectures).

mm/gup.c was recently created?
It may even make sense to move the weak version in a future patch?

Ahh thanks.
I'm currently on holiday and have very limited access to email, I'd
appreciate it if someone can keep an eye out for this during the merge
window if this conflict arises?
