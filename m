I think this works, but can you explain your rationale?

I think the main effect of your suggestion is that it is cheaper, due
to eliminating some unnecessary load/store operations.

We could go one better, and do

	mov	v0.16b, v0.16b
	mov	v1.16b, v1.16b
	// ...
	mov	v31.16b, v31.16b

which doesn't require any memory access.

But I still prefer to zero p0..p15, ffr for cleanliness, even though
the SVE programmer's model doesn't require this (unlike for the Z-reg
high bits where we do need to zero them in order not to violate the
programmer's model).

Currently sve_alloc()+task_fpsimd_load() ensures that all the non-FPSIMD
regs are zeroed too, in addition to the Z-reg high bits.

So we might want a special-purpose helper -- if so, we can do it all
with no memory access.

	pfalse	p0.b
	// ..
	pfalse	p15.b
	wrffr	p0.b

This would allow the memset-zero an sve_alloc() to be removed, but I
would need to check what other code is relying on it.

I guess I hadn't done this because I viewed it as an optimisation.

Thoughts?
