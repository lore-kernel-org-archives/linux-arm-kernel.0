Ah, so if userspace touched any FPSIMD state, then we always save that
state when entering the kernel, even if we're just going to return to
the same userspace process anyway?  (For any system call etc.?)

I see.

And even then, unnecessary because it would duplicate the existing state
save, IIUC above.

ok, I'll try to incorporate this as a separate patch for the next

ok, that would indeed also be useful for things like switching to a
vhost thread and returning to the vcpu thread.

Agreed, we can always add things later.
