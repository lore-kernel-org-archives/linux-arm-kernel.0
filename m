I think that's impossible, because we gave userspace permission to
read 0xffff0ff0 directly without using __kuser_get_tls.  You're
talking about potentially breaking userspace.

If you disable kuser helpers, then the page becomes read-only and
invisible to userspace anyway.  So, everything is being done there
which can be done - if you have kuser helpers enabled, then you
lose some opportunities for these security improvements.
