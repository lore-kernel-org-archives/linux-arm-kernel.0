I don't think we should necessarily implement it, my main concern is
when reading the code, the reader has to concince himself/herself why
this is always safe (and not just very likely to be safe).  I'm fine
with adding a comment that explains this instead of implementing
complicated logic though.  What do you think?

Ah right, it's just that I wasn't thinking of the size in terms of
always being page aligned, so couldn't you here attempt two 4K
allocations on a 64K page system, where one would overwrite the other?
