There are details in ARM DDI 0487A.k_iss10775, Chapter H1, "About
External Debug", page H1-4839 onwards. Otherwise, executive summary
below.

An external debugger can place a CPU into debug state. This is
orthogonal to execution state and exception level, which are unchanged.
While in this state, the CPU (only) executes instructions fed to it by
the debugger through a special register.

To install a SW breakpoint, the debugger makes the CPU enter debug
state, then issues regular stores, barriers, and cache maintenance.
These operate in the current execution state at the current EL, using
the current translation regime.

The external debugger can also trap exceptions (e.g. those caused by the
SW breakpoint). The CPU enters debug state when these are trapped.

My understanding is that we cannot.

Thanks,
