Regardless of the semantic associated to the word "invariant" in the
English language, the documentation characterises a channel configured
in best effort delivery mode as "invariant".  This is also the
opposite of the "guaranteed" mode where packets are guaranteed to be
delivered.  Adding a few comments here is probably a good idea.

Yes, that was the intended behaviour - to allow user space to see in
what mode channels are configured (guaranteed/invariant).

The interface asks if the channel is configured in "guaranteed" mode.
If not and because there isn't another mode available, it is
automatically in "invariant" mode.

But as I pointed out in my earlier email this may no longer needed.
One has to issue a system call anyway, might as well just go ahead
with the configuration request.

Thanks,
