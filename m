I guess I wouldn't have expected synchronous without CFCFG=1

I expect it dies before the irq handler returns..

possibly the behavior of terminated translations returning zero's
might be some detail of qcom's implementation (or how the gpu reacts
to terminated memory transactions, etc), rather than something the
spec expects/specifies.

I'll try and get you a dump of FSR in next couple days.. (need to
switch kernels and write up some test code to trigger faults)
