I can give these a go tomorrow.

These *should* fault, and IIUC should trigger the usual "Unable to handle
kernel %s at virtual address %08lx\n" splat from arm64's __do_kernel_fault(),
which should end up with an Oops().

Since these don't mess with the SP, they shouldn't trigger the overflow
detection, which detects whether we have sufficient stack space to store the
exception context to the stack. That caught the LKDTM overflow test reliably.

Thanks,
Mark.
