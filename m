I don't understand this question.  When we get where?

Because there is no enforced ordering between creating VCPUs and
creating the VGIC.

See above.  AFAICT we don't have a single point at which we can do
everything because creation of the two components can be interleaved.

We could hook into kvm_vcpu_first_run_init(), but then userspace can
observe uninitialized values if it looks at the GIC state prior to
running the VCPUs, which is also not great.

In other words, I think the problem is that you can do:

  create_vcpu(0);
  create_vgic(v3);
  create_vcpu(2);

Now you'll have vcpu0 have its private IRQs set to group 0, and you'll
have vcpu1 have its private IRQs set to group 1 (prior to my patch).


Am I missing something?
