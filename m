Yes, please.

I think I'd prefer the latter. It makes the whole pointer stuff a lot
easier to understand (the linkages are basically static), and using
flags is consistent with the way the rest of the kernel works. I'm not
sure whether we need to add a new flag or simply rely on the existing
thread flag, but that for you to decide.

OK, that makes sense now.

Yup, looks good.

Yes, no problem. I'll eyeball the changes and let you know if I spot
anything.
