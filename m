It seems that QEMU target-arm ignores the level parameter to kvm_arch_put_registers completely.

Is it intended?

Actually even the first set of the cntvoff is wrong, although it does not cause any problems.

When the VM is created, KVM already sets the cntvoff, so even putting the state once at RESET is I think wrong: the VM already has a CNTVOFF when it is created, so trying to change it afterwards even once should be avoided I think.

But if the RFC is committed as is to kvm, it's fine by me also.
