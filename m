+1.

vcpu_ids, indexes or any other constructs are just a bunch
of KVM-specific definitions that do not describe the VM from an
architecture PoV. In contrast, the MPIDR is guaranteed to be unique
stable, and identifies a given (v)CPU.

As for the PMU: either 1) we instantiate it together with the CPU
(with a new capability/feature), or 2) we map it to a MPIDR, and
associate it with its vcpu at runtime.

I'm slightly in favor of 1), as it simplifies things a bit, but 2) is
doable as well (GICv3 has similar requirements).
