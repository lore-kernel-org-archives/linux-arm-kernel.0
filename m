We found this issue too. And it is because the version is different from
the glibc wanted. We define 2.6.39 for lp64 but 2.6 for ilp32 in vdso
in kernel:
+VERSION
+{
+	LINUX_2.6 {
+	global:
+		__kernel_rt_sigreturn;
+		__kernel_gettimeofday;
+		__kernel_clock_gettime;
+		__kernel_clock_getres;
+	local: *;
+	};
+}
If I change 2.6 to 2.6.39, the ilp32 application will call vdso instead
of syscall. But the result is wrong as Catalin mentioned before.

Should we set this version to 4.6 or higher version? We will need to update
the version in "sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/aarch64/init-first.c" too:
static inline void
_libc_vdso_platform_setup (void)
{
   PREPARE_VERSION (linux2639, "LINUX_2.6.39", 123718537);

   void *p = _dl_vdso_vsym ("__kernel_gettimeofday", &linux2639);
   PTR_MANGLE (p);
   VDSO_SYMBOL(gettimeofday) = p;

   p = _dl_vdso_vsym ("__kernel_clock_gettime", &linux2639);
   PTR_MANGLE (p);
   VDSO_SYMBOL(clock_gettime) = p;

   p = _dl_vdso_vsym ("__kernel_clock_getres", &linux2639);
   PTR_MANGLE (p);
   VDSO_SYMBOL(clock_getres) = p;
}
