On 32-bit we have __get_user() inline and get_user() out of line. What
was the history behind this?

As I said, I already made the change to always inline get_user/put_user
with some penalty in the Image size but it makes the code cleaner. I'm
not entirely convinced of the performance gain/loss especially on ARMv8
cores with physically tagged caches. There is room for optimisation when
I get real silicon.
