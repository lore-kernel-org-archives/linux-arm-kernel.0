That's silly. Just because PaX does it, doesn't mean it's correct. To be
honest, playing games with the CR0.WP bit is outright stupid to begin with.

Whether protected by preempt_disable or local_irq_disable, to make that
work it needs CR0 handling in the exception entry/exit at the lowest
level. And that's just a nightmare maintainence wise as it's prone to be
broken over time. Aside of that it's pointless overhead for the normal case.

The proper solution is:

write_rare(ptr, val)
{
	mp = map_shadow_rw(ptr);
	*mp = val;
	unmap_shadow_rw(mp);
}

map_shadow_rw() is essentially the same thing as we do in the highmem case
where the kernel creates a shadow mapping of the user space pages via
kmap_atomic().

It's valid (at least on x86) to have a shadow map with the same page
attributes but write enabled. That does not require any fixups of CR0 and
just works.
