Huh, I got the insight! I think that the current approach (originally by PaX
Team) should work fine despite the false positives which you described:

If some static inline function already does explicit calls (so is_leaf is
false), adding the track_stack() call will not introduce anything special that
can break the aforementioned register clobbering ABI in that function.

Does it sound reasonable?

However, I don't know what to with false negatives.

That's interesting. Could you elaborate on that?

Thanks a lot for your detailed answer. I'll follow your advice in the next
version of the patch series.

Best regards,
