Unfortunately, this last minute is too late for print-fatal-signals.
With print-fatal-signals enabled, this patch leads to misleading
"potentially unexpected fatal signal 11" warnings if a process is
SIGKILL'd at the right time.

I've seen it without userfaultfd, but it's easiest reproduced by
patching Mark's original test code [1] with the following patch and
simply running "pkill -WINCH foo; pkill -KILL foo".  This results in:

 foo: potentially unexpected fatal signal 11.

This is ARM and I haven't tested ARM64, but the same problem even exists
on x86.
