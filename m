On ARM each source, i.e entity capable of accessing STM channels, has
a different master ID set in HW.  We can't assume the IDs are
contiguous and from a SW point of view there is no way to probe the
values.

True - any value will do. The important thing to remember is that on
ARM, there is only one masterID channel (from an STM core point of
view).  But we could also proceed differently, see below for more
details.

In the ARM world masterIDs are irrelevant so why bother with them?
Writing a '-1' simply highlight this reality.

Another way of approaching the problem would be to change sw_start/end
to a bitfield that represent the valid masterIDs but in my opinion, it
is a lot of code churn for information that isn't used outside of the
decoder.
