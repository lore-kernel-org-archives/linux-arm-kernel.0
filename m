A hidden register is one where all the features have been removed (RAZ),
making it similar to an unallocated one.

No, that'd be a violation of the architecture. The unallocated ID
registers are required to be RAZ (see table D9-2 in D9.3.1), so that
software can probe for feature without running the risk of getting an UNDEF.
