Regardless of whether it's valid per the C spec or POSIX, some people
use {set,get}context and {set,long}jmp in this manner (IIRC, QEMU does
this), and my understanding is that similar tricks are in use in the
bowels of glibc.

Otherwise, my preference would be to have per-thread keys from day one.

Indeed, which is why I suggested an opt-in mechanism.

I'd forgotten to fix up the id reg emulation to enable this, but this
should be sufficient when wired up.

The painful part is that there are several fields which can imply XPAC*
are present, so userspace has to remember to check all of those fields.

Jiong, Yao, can you answer this?

I think that there's DWARF metadata for unwinding, but I'm not sure
there's an ELF annotation on an image.

Note that you may link with libraries which may or may not use pointer
auth, so a single process can have a mixture of code using pointer auth,
and code which does not.

Thanks,
Mark.
