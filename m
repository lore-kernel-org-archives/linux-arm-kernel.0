Hi Alex,

this sentence is hard to read.  Do you mean:

(a) As userspace can and will manipulate guest register, we must ensure
that any tweaking of the registers before restarting the guest happens
immediately before...

or

(b) As userspace manipulates guest registers before restarting the
guest, we must ensure that any tweaking of the register happens
immediately before...

I'm not sure I understand this last part of the sentence.  Is the point
that if we trap on a guest single-step exception we cannot easily inject
such an exception back into the guest and therefore we trap the guest if
it tries to set itself up for single-stepping?

What is our recourse then?  To just ignore the single-step setting of
the guest and execute it as normal (while single-stepping the guest from
the outside)?

trampoline code?  The trampoline code we are referring to is in
hyp-init.S.  Do you mean in EL2?  Then just sya in hyp.S or say in EL2
or in hyp mode.

I couldn't find 'pre' as an independent word in any English
dictionaries.  I'm also not entirely sure what you mean?  Who modifies
this when, and why do we need to store this?

If I understood this state correctly (see below), then guest_debug_state
is probably a better name for this struct.

hmm, not sure this is warranted if the 'saved_regs' is not the current
state of the VM, which is sort of what the vcpu_gp_regs() and friends
hint at.  Maybe I'm just not getting exactly what piece of state it is.

we may mess with?  Can you be more specific?

If not, we must prevent the guest from modifying them.

Why must we prevent the guest from modifying them if we're not
single-stepping the guest?

Can you be more specific than "messed with"?  "... bits that may have
been modified if we were debugging the guest" ?

Drew's suggestion may make this easier to read...

So the debug_saved_reg is simply the guest's view of the debug
registers?  In that case I think vcpu_guest_dbg_reg() is more clear.
