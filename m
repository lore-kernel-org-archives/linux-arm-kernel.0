The pinning comes after the threads are created, but before they are
run. The virtual topology created for a guest may or may not map well
to the physical topology of a given host. That's not the problem of
the emulation though. That's a problem of a high level application
trying to fit it.

To test the virtual topology only requires booting a guest, whether
the vcpus are pinned or not. To test that it was worth the effort to
create a virtual topology does require the pinning, and the perf
measuring. However we still don't need the pinning in QEMU. We can
start a guest paused, run a script that does a handful of tasksets,
and then resumes the guest. Or, just use libvirt, which allows one
to save vcpu affinities, and thus on guest launch it will automatically
do the affinity setting for you.

Yup. I'm hoping Ashok will chime in to share any userspace status
they have.
