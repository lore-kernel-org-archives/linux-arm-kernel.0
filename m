Yes.

I just worried that removing an existing construct is not a simple job.
You introduced 3 attributes: DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE, ***COHERENT and
***NO_KERNEL_VADDR

I replied earlier, I also indicated that write combining option for
dma_alloc_*() is required.
But it does not mean dma_map_ops must support that.
I think dma_alloc_writecombine() can be implemented regardless of dma_map_ops.

I meant that I think DMA_ATTR_NOKERNELVADDR is not required because
you also introduced mmap callback.
