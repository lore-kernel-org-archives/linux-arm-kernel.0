We are definitely on the same page here, just using slightly different terms.

We are in total agreement.

I suggest "Shared channels"?  In the end, that's really what it is...

The outstanding issue is still how to represent these to different way
of mapping things in the STM core.  I suggested a flag, called
"mstatic" (but that can be changed), and a representation of '-1' in
for masterIDs sysFS.  Whether we stick with that or not is irrelevant,
I'd be fine with another mechanism.  What I am keen on is that from
sysFS users can quickly tell which heuristic is enacted on that
specific architecture.

I'm not sure I get what you mean here.  On ARM the masterIDs assigned
in HW, which will depend on the state, will show up in the STP stream.
But again, I might be missing your point.
