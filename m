ICH_VMCR_EL2 provides virtual access to ICC_CTLR_EL1, PMR_EL1, BPR0_EL1,
and few more regs. So access for these registers, we rely on VMCR_EL2.
and more over VMCR_EL2 is EL2 register to expose to userspace.

Ok, I will save and restore this registers with some verification in

You have added a comment for vgic_uaccess() that conversion is required
from the patch commit c3199f28e09496aa9fec9313b4f6e90e7dc913f0
"KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: Export register access interface"

If sysregs does not have endianess, then this conversion can be dropped
for sysregs.
