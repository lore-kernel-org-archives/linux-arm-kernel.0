>From a look at the git history, and a chat with Catalin, it sounds like
the SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE granularity is a historical artifact. It happened
to be easier to implement it that way at some point in the past, but
there's no reason the 4K/16K/64K cases can't all be handled by the same
code that would go down to PAGE_SIZE granularity, using sections if
possible.

I'll drop that on the TODO list.

As far as I can see, it implicitly rounds the base down and end up to
SWAPPER_BLOCK_SIZE granularity.

I can see that it might map too much memory, but I can't see why that
should trigger KASAN failures. Regardless of what was mapped KASAN
should stick to the region it cares about, and everything else should
stay out of that.

When do you see the failures, and are they in any way consistent?

Do you have an example to hand?

I haven't managed to trigger KASAN failures with the rounding removed.
I'm using 4K pages, and running under KVM tool (no EFI, so the memory
map is a contiguous block).

What does your memory map look like?

Thanks,
Mark.
