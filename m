Thanks for the list, that's good to have around for the future.

There's also the potential of the EL2 virtual timer for nested VHE
support, right?

So if we keep this we're kind of suggesting that we'll have a field per
device type later on.  Since this is a u8 and we are talking about up 5
5 timers already, there's not much waste currently, and we have plenty
of padding.  I suppose we an always add a 'other_devices' thing later,
so I prefer just sticking with this one for now.

Thanks,
