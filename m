These two changes really make me feel like kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable()
should be changed to check for both flags and all thes eplaces should
check for runnable instead.

To make the runnable function more robust, perhaps it should check:

1. The vcpu is neither paused nor powered off
2. The vcpu is not in a WFI state (vcpu->arch.wfi_request) OR there are
   pending interrupts (the current check).

Then the logic would fit the name of the function, instead of being a
specific check only called through handle_wfx.

so why do we need to re-check the pause flag, but not the power_off
flag?  That is non-trivial for sure, so if it's correct, deserves a
comment.  Also see my comment on the last patch.

Probably need to be more clear about this being an implementation
requirement rather than being guest visible or related to any
architectural concept.
