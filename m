I don't think we should consider individual MMU configurations. KSMA is the
motivation for making swapper_pg_dir read-only.
When making swapper_pg_dir read-only it should work in the same way for all
configurations as its simpler.

Please leave this as FIX_PGD that you removed in the previous patch. Depending
on the folding pmd/pud can be used as the top level. If we always use the fixmap
entry that goes with the name, its clear how these operate.

How come you don't touch pgd_populate()? Surely with a 4-level configuration we
may need to put a new pud-table in when we use a fresh chunk of vmalloc space...

(ah, this is because you are conditionally doing all this on configurations
where the MMU has top-level block mappings. I think this is unnecessarily
complicated, we should just do it all the time)

Please make this depend on the number of levels not the VA size. We also have
3-level page tables for 64K with 48bit VA space, and 16K with 47bit VA space.

I'd prefer some "if (CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS == 3)" style check, as that way the
compiler will always parse the code that is currently hidden behind #ifdefs.

We can avoid use of fixmap entries for subsequent levels by making the check
something like:
| if (CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS == 3 && magic_helper(pud) == swapper_pg_dir)

Can't we use pud_set_fixmap for pud levels?

Do we need an extra spinlock?, won't init_mm.page_table_lock always be held?
(we can put a lockdep_assert_held() in here to find cases that aren't).

It feels like there should be a helper for this.

I'm not comfortable assuming mm=init_mm means we are actually modifying
swapper_pg_dir. Hibernate does this on the grounds that the tables it generates
will be used as the kernel's mm when it starts restoring. This field wasn't used
before, so it wasn't clear what the field was for. I'm sure we will find
something else doing this...

Could we test that the provided pudp is within swapper_pg_dir before invoking
the fixmap path.

(Changes here are cleanup, they should be in a separate patch)

As we no longer modify swapper_pg_dir with the MMU disabled I think this is safe.

With the current placement of swapper_pg_dir after the BSS we rely on this to
zero that memory. It may have junk left over from the boot loader as this is the
area where the kernel's memory-footprint is bigger than the Image file.

Your vmlinux.lds.S changes below conditionally move swapper_pg_dir around.
Sometimes you need this, sometimes you don't.

Please always keep these pgd in the read-only section. I think we should keep
the page-zeroing as a sanity check, we only do it once during boot, and
corruption here isn't something we would be able to debug easily.

I think we should always do this read-only-swapper, even if there aren't any
top-level block-mappings. The code will be much more maintainable this way.
