Subject: [PATCH v5 0/8] Handle forwarded level-triggered interrupts
Message-ID: <20171120191649.17290-1-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series illustrates an alternative approach to Eric Auger's direct
EOI setup patches [1] in terms of the KVM VGIC support.

The idea is to maintain existing semantics for the VGIC for mapped
level-triggered IRQs and also support the timer using mapped IRQs with
the same VGIC support as VFIO interrupts.

Based on kvm-arm-gicv4-for-v4.15 (latest pull request of KVM/ARM changes
to the KVM tree).

(Apologies for sending this out during the merge window, but I've been
sitting on these for a while, and the VHE optimization patches have
gotten a fair amount of review lately, and I'd like to base the next
version on these patches.)

Changes since v4:
 - Rebased on the timer optimization series merged in the v4.15 merge
   window, which caused a fair amount of modifications to patch 3.
 - Added a static key to disable the sync operations when no VMs are
   using userspace irqchips to further optimize the performance
 - Fixed extra semicolon in vgic-mmio.c
 - Added commentary as requested during review
 - Dropped what was patch 4, because it was merged as part of GICv4
   support.
 - Factored out the VGIC input level function change as separate patch
   (helps bisect and debugging), before providing a function for the
   timer.

Changes since v3:
 - Added a number of patches and moved patches around a bit.
 - Check for uaccesses in the mmio handler functions
 - Fixed bugs in the mmio handler functions

Changes since v2:
 - Removed patch 5 from v2 and integrating the changes in what's now
   patch 5 to make it easier to reuse code when adding VFIO integration.
 - Changed the virtual distributor MMIO handling to use the
   pending_latch and more closely match the semantics of SPENDR and
   CPENDR for both level and edge mapped interrupts.

Changes since v1:
 - Added necessary changes to the timer (Patch 1)
 - Added handling of guest MMIO accesses to the virtual distributor
   (Patch 4)
 - Addressed Marc's comments from the initial RFC (mostly renames)

Thanks,
-Christoffer
