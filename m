yes, Here I mean EL3 firmware reads the RAS Error record register ERXxxx_EL1, such as
ERXADDR_EL1/ERXMISC0_EL1, to get the detailed error info, then record them to
HEST->GHES ACPI table in a memory region.

Firstly, the guest OS usually runs in the El1 or El0, not El2.
if El2 happens an SError, it will trap to EL3 firmware even though the PSTATE.A is set.
Because the PSTATE.A can not mask it if the SError is trapped to EL3.

the External Abort is masked, but when SCR_EL3.EA is set, the pstate.A can not mask the Error.

KVM does not parse the CPER records, I mean KVM classified the error according to the esr_el2.AET.

As shown below:

AET, bits [12:10], when categorized
Asynchronous Error Type. Describes the state of the PE after taking the SError interrupt exception.
Software might use the information in the syndrome registers to determine what recovery might be
possible. See Architecturally consumed errors. The possible values of this field are:
0b000 Uncontainable error (UC).
0b001 Unrecoverable error (UEU).
0b010 Restartable error (UEO).
0b011 Recoverable error (UER).
0b110 Corrected error (CE).

I pasted the code here:
+static int kvm_handle_guest_sei(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
+{
+	unsigned int esr = kvm_vcpu_get_hsr(vcpu);
+	bool impdef_syndrome =  esr & ESR_ELx_ISV;	/* aka IDS */
+	unsigned int aet = esr & ESR_ELx_AET;
+
+	/*
+	 * In below three conditions, it will directly inject the virtual SError.
+	 * 1. Not support RAS extension; the Syndrome is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED;
+	 * AET is RES0 if 'the value returned in the DFSC field is not
+	 * [ESR_ELx_FSC_SERROR]'
+	 */
+	if (!cpus_have_const_cap(ARM64_HAS_RAS_EXTN) || impdef_syndrome ||
+			((esr & ESR_ELx_FSC) != ESR_ELx_FSC_SERROR)) {
+		kvm_inject_vabt(vcpu);
+		return 1;
+	}
+
+	switch (aet) {
+	case ESR_ELx_AET_CE:	/* corrected error */
+	case ESR_ELx_AET_UEO:	/* restartable error, not yet consumed */
+		return 0;	/* continue processing the guest exit */
+	case ESR_ELx_AET_UEU:  /* The error has not been propagated */
+	/*
+	 * Only handle the guest user mode SEI if the error has not been propagated
+	 */
+	if ((!vcpu_mode_priv(vcpu)) && !handle_guest_sei(kvm_vcpu_get_hsr(vcpu)))
+		return 1;
+
+	/* If SError handling is failed, continue run */
+	default:
+		/*
+		 * Until now, the CPU supports RAS and SEI is fatal, or user space
+		 * does not support to handle the SError.
+		 */
+		panic("This Asynchronous SError interrupt is dangerous, panic");
+	}
+}
+

I have called the kernel code to handle the SError.

+/*
+ * Handle SError interrupt that occur in guest OS.
+ *
+ * The return value will be zero if the SEI was successfully handled
+ * and non-zero if handling is failed.
+ */
+int handle_guest_sei(unsigned int esr)
+{
+	int ret = 0;
+
+	struct siginfo info;
+
+	pr_alert("Asynchronous SError interrupt detected on CPU: %d, esr: %x\n",
+		smp_processor_id(), esr);
+
+	info.si_signo = SIGBUS;
+	info.si_errno = 0;
+	info.si_code  = BUS_MCEERR_AR;
+	/*

+	 */
+	info.si_addr = NULL;
+
+	ret = force_sig_info(SIGBUS, &info, current);
+	if (ret < 0)
+		pr_info("Handle guest SEI: Error sending signal to %s:%d: %d\n",

+

For the SError, it is asynchronous abort. so it is not better to call memory_failure() helper, because the error
address is not accurate. memory_failure() will offline or poison the address, but the address is not accurate. so it is
dangerous

No, not firmware bug. At least in the armv8.0 CPU and huawei's armv8.2 CPU, the architecture
decided it is not accurate, this abort is asynchronous not synchronous.

maybe we can not get the accurate error address, can you get it in your armv8 platform?

In our platform, the physical address in CPER records also does not accurate for SEI. do you have accurate error physical address
for the SEI?

I can call APEI kernel driver to parse the severity except doing recovery for the address.
May be it is not better handle the physical address that recorded in the CPER, because the error address is not accurate

That is, the error was detected but not consumed

For guest OS user space SError, if it is not propagated. let guest OS handles, for example,killing
this APP is better, which can avoid terminate the whole guest OS.
if only host kernel handle them, it can not kill guest os APP.
