Yes, that's right: the guest can't touch the SVE-specific registers
Pn/FFR, but FPSIMD accesses to Vn regs cause the high bits of the
corresponding SVE Zn registers to be clobbered.  In any case, the
FPSIMD restore done by KVM after guest exit is sufficient to clobber
those bits even if the guest didn't do it.

This is a band-aid for not making the KVM world switch code properly
SVE-aware yet.

Does the following wording sound better:

--8<--

On guest exit, high bits of the SVE Zn registers may have been
clobbered as a side-effect the execution of FPSIMD instructions in
the guest.  The existing KVM host FPSIMD restore code is not
sufficient to restore these bits, so this patch explicitly marks
the CPU as not containing cached vector state for any task, this
forcing a reload on the next return to userspace.  This is an
interim measure, in advance of adding full SVE awareness to KVM.

Because of the duplication of this operation
(__this_cpu_write(fpsimd_last_state, NULL)), it is factored out as
a new helper fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() to make the purpose clearer.

Thanks, let me know about the above wording change though.
