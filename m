Seems like the documentation is more out of date than we thought, see
below.

Is this true? I seem to remember that we established it wasn't (back
when we redesigned the vgic). Certainly, the current code relies on
the Active bit being cleared in the LR as well as in the physical
distributor.

And this isn't either, if my above assertion stands.

This isn't true either. We now handle the timer interrupt on the host.
