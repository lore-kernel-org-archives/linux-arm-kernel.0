Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] arm: Add ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE

Hi,

This patch series are to select ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOUCE on arm.
A lot of architectures already select ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE
to support CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE that detects overflows at compile-time.
(6974f0c4555e ("include/linux/string.h:
add the option of fortified string.h functions)
ARM can be built and run with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

Additionally, modify vdso.c to remove compile-error that happens
when built arm kernel with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE.

v2 : 
Fix build error reported by kbuild test robot.
- Add fortify_panic() in arch/arm/boot/compressed/misc.c,
  because arch/arm/boot/compressed/* can't find that function.
