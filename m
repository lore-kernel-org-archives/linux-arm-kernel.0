I want to apologize for the disagreement.  In part of my due diligence
for cleaning up the signal handling I am introducing some helpers for
generating siginfo.  I decided to ask which kind of helpers should I
introduce.

Very basic generic helpers that just wrap the current functionality
today.  Or some slightly smarter helpers that solve some other problems
as well.  After consideration I am shelving the smarter helpers for now,
as the need to introduce the helpers universally is strong, so that I
can guarantee struct siginfo is always fully initialized before being
passed to userspace.

Given the choice between force_sig_info and send_sig_info I agree that
send_sig_info is the right choice for signals that can be ignored.

The problem I was focusing on is the problem where force_sig_info and
send_sig_info can be tricked into causing the instruction pointer to
point to the wrong instruction (even when the signal is not blocked),
due to the delivery of another signal.

So I was wondering if in practice we could introduce a singal delivery
function that would operation synchronously and would solve the
instruction pointer problem.

It looks to me like this location on arm where we are using
send_sig_info is a clear candidate for such a function as long as it has
a mode where you can say deliverly the signal like send_sig_info if the
signal is blocked.

Still like I said such a smarter helper is not the priority and I don't
intend any semantic changes when I introduce helpers into the signal
deliver path.  Just fewer places initializing struct siginfo.
