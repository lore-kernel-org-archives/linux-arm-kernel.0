Subject: [PATCH 0/2] arm64: Support systems without FP/ASIMD
Message-ID: <1477403433-2279-1-git-send-email-suzuki.poulose@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This series adds supports to the kernel and KVM hyp to handle
systems without FP/ASIMD properly. At the moment the kernel
doesn't check if the FP unit is available before accessing
the registers (e.g during context switch). Also for KVM,
we trap the FP/ASIMD accesses and handle it by injecting an
undefined instruction into the VM on systems without FP.

Tested on a FVP_Base-AEM-v8A model by disabling VFP on at
least one CPU ( -C clusterX.cpuY.vfp-present=0 ).
