Yes,  I should have done that..

We panic for for both impdef and uncontainable ESR values, so the difference
doesn't matter. I'll remove the 'is_ras_serror()' in here and make it the
callers problem to check...


RES0 encodings?
If this is an imp-def 'all zeros', those should all be matched as impdef by
arm64_is_ras_serror().
Otherwise its a RAS encoding with {I,D}FSC bits that indicate we can't know the
severity.
The ARM-ARM calls these 'uncategorized'. Yes I'm treating them as uncontained,
(on aarch32 these share an encoding). I'll add a comment to call it out.

Ooer, differing CPU support. I hadn't considered that... wouldn't cpufeature
declare such a system insane?

Makeing the HAS_RAS tests use this_cpu_has_cap() should cover this, but will
cause problems for KVM as it calls these from a pre-emptible context.

.. well that was obvious. Yes, I was looking too much at whether we could return
to the interrupted context instead of what we do next!
