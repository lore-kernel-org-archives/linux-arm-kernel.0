Yup.

I think that we absolutely want to do all the CPU state advancement (PC,
SS bit, etc) at the point we apply the effects of the instruction. Not
before we emulate the instruction, and not higher/lower in the call
stack.

We have a big problem in that guest-directed singlestep and
host-directed singlestep don't compose, and given that host-directed
singlestep doesn't work reliably today I'd be tempted to rip that out
until we've fixed guest-directed singlestep.

We should have a story for how host-directed debug is handled
transparently from the PoV of a guest using guest-directed debug.

Thanks,
Mark.
