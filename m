So while trying to find the best possible solution for this seemingly
simple problem, I was wondering why we had this allocation function in
the first place?
It seems a bit overkill to allocate a handle if we could just go with
static values.
I changed the first two patches now to have an enum per architecture to
list all possible handles and then just using those values directly
instead of going through another layer of indirection.

So is there anything that will require dynamic phandles in the future?
This version proposed here can't really cope with them anyway and in the
moment it's just about _one_ GIC phandle and _one_ ITS phandle, so a
static assignment is much simpler.

Will we need multiple ITSes for device passthrough? Or would it just be
one ITS for all hardware devices and one for emulated virtio?

Or do I miss anything else here?

Cheers,
Andre.
