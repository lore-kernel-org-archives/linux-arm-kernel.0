This looks right to me, but I'm a bit unclear what the types of this is
and how to use it.

Are orig and alt function pointers and cond is a CONFIG_FOO ?  fname is
a symbol, which is defined as a prototype somewhere and then implemented
here, or?

Perhaps a Usage: part of the docs would be helpful.

I haven't thought much about how all of this is implemented, but from my
point of views the ideal situation would be something like:

void foo(int a, int b)
{
	ALTERNATIVE_IF_NOT CONFIG_BAR
	foo_legacy(a, b);
	ALTERNATIVE_ELSE
	foo_new(a, b);
	ALTERNATIVE_END
}

I realize this may be impossible because the C code could implement all
sort of fun stuff around the actual function calls, but would there be
some way to annotate the functions and find the actual branch statement
and change the target?

Apologies if this question is just outright ridiculous.
