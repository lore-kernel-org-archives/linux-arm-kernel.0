OK, I shall put bit more explanation. I was trying to avoid too much
exposition in the commit comments vs the code.

Maybe I should cut from "This does get..." and put more explanation in
the single step comment later.

Correct. As MDCR_EL2.TDE is in effect everything gets routed to EL2. For
breakpoints this is not a major problem as we have all the details
for user space to re-inject the exception if required. However for
single-step it means we get an exception as soon as the guest enables
MDSCR_EL1.SS even if it doesn't have MDSCR_EL1.KDE enabled. The guest
would only be expecting the single step to kick in when it eret's to EL0
setting PSTATE.SS.

In future we could consider getting userspace to singlestep the guest
out of the kernel until it goes over the eret but this is starting to
get hairy.

Well nothing breaks per-se but if you have a GDB session in the guest
you'll wonder why "start" and the various breaks don't trigger. They
actually will but the host GDB then tries to SS over them and we
continue on until the host has stopped doing any sort of debug.
