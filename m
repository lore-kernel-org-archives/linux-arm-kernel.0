Subject: [PATCH v2] arm/arm64: KVM: Properly account for guest CPU time
Message-ID: <1432838950-28774-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Until now we have been calling kvm_guest_exit after re-enabling
interrupts when we come back from the guest, but this has the
unfortunate effect that CPU time accounting done in the context of timer
interrupts occurring while the guest is running doesn't properly notice
that the time since the last tick was spent in the guest.

Inspired by the comment in the x86 code, move the kvm_guest_exit() call
below the local_irq_enable() call and change __kvm_guest_exit() to
kvm_guest_exit(), because we are now calling this function with
interrupts enabled.  We have to now explicitly disable preemption and
not enable preemption before we've called kvm_guest_exit(), since
otherwise we could be preempted and everything happening before we
eventually get scheduled again would be accounted for as guest time.

At the same time, move the trace_kvm_exit() call outside of the atomic
section, since there is no reason for us to do that with interrupts
disabled.

This patch is based on kvm/queue, because it has the kvm_guest_enter/exit
rework recently posted by Christian Borntraeger.  I hope I got the logic
of this right, there were 2 slightly worrying facts about this:

First, we now enable and disable and enable interrupts on each exit
path, but I couldn't see any performance overhead on hackbench - yes the
only benchmark we care about.

Second, looking at the ppc and mips code, they seem to also call
kvm_guest_exit() before enabling interrupts, so I don't understand how
guest CPU time accounting works on those architectures.

Changes since v1:
 - Tweak comment and commit text based on Marc's feedback.
 - Explicitly disable preemption and enable it only after kvm_guest_exit().
