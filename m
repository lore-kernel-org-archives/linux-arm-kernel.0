Yup. You can even loose the low 8 bits, as this is guaranteed to be 256
byte aligned. So for a 48bit IPA and 32bit of EventID, you end up only
using 45 bits, which leaves quite a few to spare, should we ever want a
larger IPA. Ideally, this should contain the relevant fields of the MAPD
command, with similar sizes.
