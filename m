So, I feel that there is quite some unneeded copying and masking on the
way, but a real fix would be quite invasive and needs quite some testing
and review. I don't feel like rushing this into a v2 of this series.
I quickly did what you proposed (replacing memcpy by pointer
assignment), and that seems to work, but I don't have many chances of
testing this this weekend, since I am on the road. Also I have to dig
out my cross-endian test scripts first. So not sure if you want to take
the risk with this series.
I changed the other minor points you mentioned in the review though, so
do you want to have a "v1.5" or how do we proceed from here?

Cheers,
Andre.
