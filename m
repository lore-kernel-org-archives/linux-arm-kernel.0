Not really because this register is also described as part of the
context switching operation, so that would be an exception to the
general rule of requiring TLB invalidation for cached registers.

If you keep reading the same paragraph, the ARM ARM becomes more
subjective ;) and you may come to the conclusion that the reserved ASID
(not TCR_EL1.A1 though) + TCR_EL1.EDP0 would do the trick but we need
clarification from the architects rather than my random interpretation:

Section "D4.7.1 General TLB maintenance requirements" states:

  Some System register field descriptions state that the effect of the
  field is permitted to be cached in a TLB. This means that all TLB
  entries that might be affected by a change of the field must be
  invalidated whenever that field is changed

So the above kind of implies that only TLB *entries* that might be
affected by a change of a control bit need to be invalidated and only
the effect of such bit is cached (rather than the bit itself). The
effect of EDP0==1 is that there is no page table walk on a miss, so
there won't be any new entries cached in the TLB that would
reflect/cache the effect of EDP0==1. We still need to follow this by a
switch to the reserved ASID to make sure there are no other TLB entries
for TTBR0 (and we shouldn't care about the window between EDP0=1 and
ASID=reserved).

Anyway, the above wouldn't help the code much since we still need to
preserve/restore/switch the ASID of the current thread (that's unless we
temporarily store TTBR0_EL1.ASID into the TTBR1_EL1.ASID field). The
TCR_EL1.A1 trick would have been nice but explicitly rejected by the
architects (I guess it's not part of the context switching sequence, so
the hardware may not notice the A1 bit change).
