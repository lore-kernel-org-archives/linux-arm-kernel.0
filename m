I thought about this, but wanted to retain the clear relationship
between the _ENABLED flag and the state of the FPSIMD trap controls.

The HOST flag has no direct relationship with trap controls, so these
seemed different enough things to justify different names, though the
inconsistency was a bit annoying.

Thanks.  I'll probably leave it as is, but shout if you're unhappy with
this.
