Subject: [PATCH v7 00/17] KVM: arm64: GICv3 ITS emulation
Message-ID: <20160628123230.26255-1-andre.przywara@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hi,

another try on the KVM ITS emulation support.
It allows those KVM guests that use an emulated GICv3 to use LPIs as
well, though in the moment this is limited to emulated PCI devices.
This is based on kvm-arm-for-v4.7-rc2 and relies on the new VGIC
implementation.

Compared to the last drop there have been some changes to the code:
The reference counting has been rewritten to use the kref infrastructure.
This has some implications on the rest of the code, for instance the
locking for the LPI list got changed. There is no RCU usage anymore,
instead the LPI list is now protected by a spinlock. To overcome the
problem where we need to access guest memory while holding the lock,
we create a snapshot of the LPI list, so we can iterate over LPIs with
the lock dropped.
Also the base register sanitisation has been reworked completely, which
includes some changes to the arm-gic-v3.h header file (as a separate
patch 07/17). I hope I covered all the subtleties of those bits.
Also the MMIO framework saw some changes, we now tag the different GIC
regions explicitly and are able to call the different handlers explicitly.
Also Patch 05/17 extends the kvm-io-bus framework with a small function
to get the kvm_io_device structure for a given MMIO address. This allows
us to keep the knowledge of all the ITSes in this framework, but still
get the respective ITS pointer easily without reverting to "fake" MMIO
accesses.
Also all the smaller review comments have been addressed.

You can find all of this code (and the prerequisites) in the
its-emul/v7 branch of my repository [1].
This has been briefly tested on the model and on GICv3 hardware.
If you have GICv3 capable hardware, please test it on your setup.
Also of course any review comments are very welcome!

Cheers,
Andre.

---------------

The GICv3 ITS (Interrupt Translation Service) is a part of the
ARM GICv3 interrupt controller [3] used for implementing MSIs.
It specifies a new kind of interrupts (LPIs), which are mapped to
establish a connection between a device, its MSI payload value and
the target processor the IRQ is eventually delivered to.
In order to allow using MSIs in an ARM64 KVM guest, we emulate this
ITS widget in the kernel.
The ITS works by reading commands written by software (from the guest
in our case) into a (guest allocated) memory region and establishing
the mapping between a device, the MSI payload and the target CPU.
We parse these commands and update our internal data structures to
reflect those changes. On an MSI injection we iterate those
structures to learn the LPI number we have to inject.
For the time being we use simple lists to hold the data, this is
good enough for the small number of entries each of the components
currently have. Should this become a performance bottleneck in the
future, those can be extended to arrays or trees if needed.

Most of the code lives in a separate source file (vgic-its.c), though
there are some changes necessary in the existing VGIC files.

For the time being this series gives us the ability to use emulated
PCI devices that can use MSIs in the guest. Those have to be
triggered by letting the userland device emulation simulate the MSI
write with the KVM_SIGNAL_MSI ioctl. This will be translated into
the proper LPI by the ITS emulation and injected into the guest in
the usual way (just with a higher IRQ number).

This series is based on kvm-arm-for-v4.7-rc2 and can be found at the
its-emul/v7 branch of this repository [1].
For this to be used you need a GICv3 host machine (a fast model would
do), though it does not rely on any host ITS bits (neither in hardware
or software).

To test this you can use the kvmtool patches available in the "its-v6"
branch here [2].
Start a guest with: "$ lkvm run --irqchip=gicv3-its --force-pci"
and see the ITS being used for instance by the virtio devices.
