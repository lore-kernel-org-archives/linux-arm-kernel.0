What if HW_PERF_EVENTS is not selected? Also, selecting HW_PERF_EVENTS
is not enough, and you probably need PERF_EVENTS as well, So this should
probably read:

	select KVM_ARM_PMU if (HW_PERF_EVENTS && PERF_EVENTS)

The repetition of #ifdef CONFIG_KVM_ARM_PMU is a bit ugly. How about
something like this instead:

#ifndef __ASM_ARM_KVM_PMU_H
#define __ASM_ARM_KVM_PMU_H

#ifdef CONFIG_KVM_ARM_PMU

#include <linux/perf_event.h>
#include <asm/pmu.h>

struct kvm_pmc {
	u8 idx;/* index into the pmu->pmc array */
	struct perf_event *perf_event;
	u64 bitmask;
};

struct kvm_pmu {
	/* PMU IRQ Number per VCPU */
	int irq_num;
	struct kvm_pmc pmc[ARMV8_MAX_COUNTERS];
};

#else

struct kvm_pmu {
};

#endif

#endif

and you can then populate the rest of the function prototype and stubs
where needed.

Thanks,
