FWIW, I'm currently working on this (atop of Andy's x86 patches). The
IRQ stack work largely removed out dependence on the stack pointer to
find thread_info, and I have a plan for the remaining places.

There's a fair amount of ground work to do first (e.g. reworking headers
to avoid circular dependencies), but hopefully I'll have something that
I can share soon.

Thanks,
Mark.
