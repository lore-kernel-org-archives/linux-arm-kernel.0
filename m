Subject: [PATCH 29/74] Newly erased page read workaround

From: Vipin Kumar <vipin.kumar@st.com>

A newly erased page contains ff in data as well as spare area. While reading an
erased page, the read out ecc from spare area does not match the ecc generated
by fsmc ecc hardware accelarator. This is because ecc of data ff ff is not ff
ff. This leads to errors when jffs2 fs erases and reads back the pages to
ensure consistency.

This patch adds a software workaround to ensure that the ecc check is not
performed for erased pages. An erased page is checked by checking data as ff ff.
