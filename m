I'm not sure this is actionable feedback.  The two paragraphs above
seem clear and useful to me.  How would you like to see them improved?

I understand that 02/20 is for PCI I/O port space and 03/20 is for PCI
config space.  I'm confused because I thought we wanted the same
non-posted mapping for both, but looks like they're different.

Patch 02/20 uses ioremap_page_range(..., pgprot_noncached(PAGE_KERNEL))
to map PCI I/O port space:

  #define pgprot_noncached(prot) \
          __pgprot_modify(prot, PTE_ATTRINDX_MASK, PTE_ATTRINDX(MT_DEVICE_nGnRnE) | PTE_PXN | PTE_UXN)

Patch 03/20 uses ioremap_nocache() to map PCI config space:

  #define ioremap_nocache(addr, size)     __ioremap((addr), (size), __pgprot(PROT_DEVICE_nGnRE))

So the I/O port mapping uses MT_DEVICE_nGnRnE, while the config space
mapping uses PROT_DEVICE_nGnRE, which looks different.
