Subject: [RFC PATCH 09/10] arm64: mm: add C level handling for stack overflows
In-Reply-To: <20170712144424.19528-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
References: <20170712144424.19528-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <20170712144424.19528-10-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Add the code to __do_kernel_fault() to force a panic when the faulting
address of a data abort points into the guard page below the current
task's stack.

Currently, we won't be able to make it all the way here under such a
condition, but that will be addressed in a subsequent patch.
