You wish.

There is all kind of difficulties with that. This requires checking an
EL2 register (ICH_VTR_EL2) when we've not initialised KVM yet (so no HYP
call facility). We could make it an additional hyp-stub feature, but
that feels pretty involved.

Effectively, GICv4 support having it supported on the redistributors,
the ITSs, and the CPUs. The cpufeature framework only addresses the
first one. So unless the solution encompasses all the elements in the
chain, any checking feels pretty pointless.

Thanks,
