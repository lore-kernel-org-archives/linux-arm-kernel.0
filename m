The logic here was to account for drivers that only set the 'mshared'
flag.  One could (wrongly) assume that if mshared is set in the
driver, sw_{start,end} are don't need to be set.  That way errors are
caught quicker.  I'm fine with removing that part.

Other than the above, is there anything you'd like to see modified in
this patch, i.e how the mshared flag is used to modify the output in
sysFS/configFS?

Thanks,
Mathieu

That statement should have appeared in the cover letter rather than
this patch's blurb - that way it applies cleanly.
