Where is the departure from level-triggered behavior with VFIO?  As
far as I can tell, the GIC flow of the interrupts will be just a level
interrupt, but we just need to make sure the resamplefd mechanism is
supported for both types of interrupts.  Whether or not that's a
decent mechanism seems orthogonal to me, but that's a discussion for
another day I think.
