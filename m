In QEMU, I think we need nail down how we define '-cpu host' for kvmarm.
IMO, '-cpu host' is what libvirt calls "host-passthrough"[*], and indeed
migrating a guest using host-passthrough is super risky. You need to
know what you're doing, and likely what you'll want to do is migrate to
an _identical_ host. We should start looking at building cpu models to
better support migration, but errata complicates that. However, for the
sake of argument, let's assume we solved those problems and completed the
implementation of cpu models - so we would no longer be using '-cpu host'
for a "typical" config. So what would '-cpu host' mean? It appears the
current semantics are "source host passthrough", similar to
"host-model"[*]. Rather than "whatever host I'm running on host
passthrough", which is what I think we want and what this patch and the
QEMU counterpart changes seem to be aiming at implementing. Anyway,
whichever of those two semantics we choose for '-cpu host', the user will
still need to know what they're doing and to assume the risks. Without
cpu models, I'm not even sure discussing migration safety makes sense.

(Yeah, I know I ignored big-little. IMO, big-little is an upper layer
problem, as it should just be a vcpu thread to cpu set affinity
assignment issue.)
