I figured that the code was cleaner ths way, since they're independent
bits of code that both happen to be applicable only to AArch64 guests.

This commit only adds ID_SANITISED() entries for regs that are already
present in arm64_ftr_regs[].  (If you spot any that are missing, give me
a shout...)

SVE only adds one new ID register, ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 -- but SVE defines no
fields in there yet, so I just leave it ID_UNALLOCATED() which will
cause it to read as zero for the guest.

Sounds sensible, I'll take a look at that.
