As has been noted in previous threads, the ARM architecture requires a
Break-Before-Make sequence when changing an entry from a table to a
block, as is the case here.

The means the necessary sequence is:

	1. Make the entry invalid
	2. Invalidate relevant TLB entries
	3. Write the new entry

Whereas above, the sequence is

	1. Write the new entry
	2. invalidate relevant TLB entries

Which is insufficient, and will lead to a number of problems.

Therefore, NAK to this patch.

Please read up on the Break-Before-Make requirements in the ARM ARM.

Thanks,
Mark.
