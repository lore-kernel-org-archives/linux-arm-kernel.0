This looks like the arch code's adr_this_cpu.

The disassembly looks wrong?, or it generates the wrong address?

(adr_this_cpu)

As we know adr_l used adrp to generate a PC-relative address, when executed at
EL2 it should always generate an EL2 address, so the kern_hyp_va will just mask
out some bits that are already zero.

(this subtly depends on KVM's EL2 code not being a module, and
kvm_host_cpu_state not being percpu_alloc()d)

(that looks right to me).

You expected tpidr_el2 in the above disassembly?

The patch 'arm64: alternatives: use tpidr_el2 on VHE hosts'[0] wraps the tpidr
access in adr_this_cpu,ldr_this_cpu and __my_cpu_offset() in
ARM64_HAS_VIRT_HOST_EXTN alternatives.

You should have an altinstr_replacement section that contains the 'mrs x1,
tpidr_el2' for this sequence, which will get patched in by the cpufeature code
when we find VHE.


I'm guessing you want to always use tpidr_el2 as cpu_offset for KVM, even on
v8.0 hardware. To do this you can't use the kernel's 'this_cpu_ptr' as its
defined in percpu-defs.h as:
> SHIFT_PERCPU_PTR(ptr, my_cpu_offset)

... and the arch code provides a static-inline 'my_cpu_offset' that resolves to
the correct tpidr for EL1.

I guess you need an asm-accessor for each per-cpu variable you want to access,
or a kvm_this_per_cpu().

In the SDEI series this was so that the asm that used tpidr_el2 directly had the
correct value on non-VHE hardware.


Thanks,

James
