Hi Andrew,

This is a miscellany of fixes and tweaks to the common DMA mapping code
which I've been collecting. They don't strictly depend on each other,
but I figure I may as well send them all together for the sake of
explaining them in one place:

#1 is a straightforward and hopefully obvious bugfix.
#2 has been posted before but I subsequently forgot to follow up on it.
   It's still possible to hit this at least on arm64 systems, with the
   SWIOTLB/pl330 combination blowing up just running dmatest.
#3 follows on from a recent discussion about dma_sync_sg[0]; there's
   already a related patch in -next from Sakari clarifying the docs.
#4 seemed worth posting now that the recent rework means it no longer
   has to be a sprawling touch-all-the-architectures patch for something
   so small.

Thanks,
Robin.
