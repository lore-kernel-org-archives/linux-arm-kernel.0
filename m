Yes. ldr = does not accept expressions involving symbols, only plain
symbols or expressions that evaluate to constants.

So something like

ldr <reg>, =<sym> - <label>

is rejected while the equivalent

ldr <reg>, 0f
0: .long <sym> - <label>

does work.

OK

That's a trick, actually, which I failed to add a comment for.

We use .arm sections in the thumb2 kernel, and using these macros
there would result in the wrong offset to be used. Adding the .w
suffix forces an error in the assembler which even results in a fairly
meaningful error message complaining about using .w in ARM code.

No, thumb2 does not allow that
