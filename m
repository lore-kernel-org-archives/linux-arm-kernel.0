Hi james,
  Thanks for the mail and sorry for my late response.

Thanks for the point out, I make this series in a hurry(you are
waiting this patch), forget to check again your comments before.

yes, thanks for the point out.

yes, it is read-only.

" 'If ERRSELR_EL1.SEL is
[>=]  ERRIDR_EL1.NUM' that makes the ERX* registers RAZ/WI"

This is because I want to make above simulation as you suggested, if
want to make above simulation, it needs set "vcpu->arch.ctxt.sys_regs"
to 0, instead of reading from system register.

so need a space to store it

yes, it is my mistake.

yes, if it is read only, just pick zero.

https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/kvmarm/2017-September/027176.html

you ever have below suggestion, so use a function "access_error_reg" to do it.
'If ERRSELR_EL1.SEL is
[>=]  ERRIDR_EL1.NUM' that makes the ERX* registers RAZ/WI too.

make all  to  trap_raz_wi() is simple.
