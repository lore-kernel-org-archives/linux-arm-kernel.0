Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] add PM functionality for act8945a PMIC

This series implements PM functionality for act8945a PMIC and use that support
on SAMA5D2 Xplained board.

Changes in v2:
- split patch 1/1 from previous series in 3 patches: one adding regmap,
  one adding pm functionality, one adding shutdown functionality
- use dev_pm_ops suspend function to set register specific to PWRHLD line: this
  is specific to PMIC itself and not to regulators
- add mode support for LDOs
- add constants for mode in dt-bindings/regulator/active-semi,8945a-regulator.h
- document modes and regulator suspend states
- remove rdevs from struct act8945a_pmic since were not used anywhere
- add op_mode field in struct act8945a_pmic, update it when setting mode and
  return it when reading mode (avoiding one extra register read while
  reading mode)
- add a patch to fix a checkpatch.pl warning
- in shutdown function use directly act8945a->regmap instead of an intermediary
  struct regmap variable
