I talked to Will about this the last day of Linaro Connect and we
arrived at the conclusion that since you cannot trap on only a subset of
the debug registers (namely the DBGDSCR and the registers related to the
OS lock etc.), there is simply no safe and robus way to do this on
ARMv7.

Therfore, this patch series probably needs to be reworked so that we
*always* set TDA for the guest, and when the guest programs a break- or
watchpoint, then we program the hardware registers directly in KVM
without telling perf or hw_breakpoints about this, and we only do any of
this if monitor_mode_enabled() is true.  If not, then debugging inside
the guest simply won't work.

I also don't think that checking the host's breakpoint and wathcpoint
registers are necessary after all, since they are context switched per
process on the host, so this will only be a problem for guests when the
user uses GDB on the VCPU thread (in which case he's asking for trouble
anyway) or with using the weird perf CPU-wide breakpoints, which is very
far from a the common case, so I wouldn't worry about this for now.

Hopefully this makes sense.
