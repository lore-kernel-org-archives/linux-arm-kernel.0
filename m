i think the change is ok and it is good that it is not yet in stable.

(for posix conformance only the value in libc matters though, the
kernel definition is not visible as glibc does not use it and even
in posix the semantics of this macro is not entirely clear so leaving
the wrong value in kernel uapi is not that terrible.. e.g. the x86
definition was not updated when avx extension was added, for abi
stability i guess.  in musl libc this was set to 6K when i did the
aarch64 port, had i used 5000 as the limit i would be upset by such
a change, but i have nothing to complain about now..)
