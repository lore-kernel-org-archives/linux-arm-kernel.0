Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here are the KVM/ARM Changes for v4.9. They include:

 - Various cleanups and removal of redundant code
 - Two important fixes for not using an in-kernel irqchip
 - A bit of optimizations
 - Handle SError exceptions and present them to guests if appropriate
 - Proxying of GICV access at EL2 if guest mappings are unsafe
 - GICv3 on AArch32 on ARMv8
 - Preparations for GICv3 save/restore, including ABI docs


The following changes since commit 9ac7e3e815060efdc86b6d12448200e3c3597e01:

  KVM: nVMX: expose INS/OUTS information support (2016-09-07 19:34:30 +0200)
