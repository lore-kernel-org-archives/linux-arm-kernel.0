That depends on the case, in some places it's more readable like this.
In the above case, I find it easier to compare against the documentation
which, for example, has groups of 2 bits at position 8 and 24 or 10 and
26 (for TTBR0 and TTBR1). The meaning of a group of 2 bits is described
separately as 0b00 (NC), 0b01(WBWA) etc. Same goes for the shareability
bits (12 and 28).

So I think at least for code writing it's less error-prone to write the
explicit bit position than a magic long hex.
