You can't know it. Or rather, you find out once it is too late.

Yup. I've now added some code to that effect. I may add a command-line
option to specify a "safe" DevID in the future, but only if we hit this
in real life.

I feel sorry for you :-(. I don't understand why this wasn't made
mandatory with GICv4, because the amount of pain you have to go through
to invalidate a doorbell is unbelievable.
