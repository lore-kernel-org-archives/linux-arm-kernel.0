Hi Peter,

thanks for going through the pain of looking into this!

Do we really have to? Please note that though we say our implementor is
ARM (because we lack alternatives, I think), we don't claim to be a
GIC-500, for instance, but a made-up KVM implementation.
So there is no need to implement the other ID registers, except for the
architecturally defined PIDR2, which Linux actually checks to confirm
that this is a GICv3 compliant GIC.

Yes, I had those registers defined like this in an earlier version, but
Marc's comment IIRC correctly was that we shouldn't claim to be a
GIC-500, for instance, because then we would need to mimic GIC-500
behavior quite closely, which we simply don't and also don't want to.

So architecturally we are fine, I think.

Do you think by claiming coming from ARM we are obliged to implement all
the other PIDR/CIDR registers the ARM way?

Cheers,
Andre.
