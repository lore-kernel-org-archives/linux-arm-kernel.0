As this is over my head, I've been pushing random encodings through gas/objdump
and then tracing them through here.... can this encode 0xf80000000fffffff?

gas thinks this is legal:
|   0:   92458000        and     x0, x0, #0xf80000000fffffff

I make that N=1, S=0x20, R=0x05.
(I'm still working out what 'S' means)

Won't this lose the top bit of a 64bit immediate?

(but then you put it back later, so something funny is going on)

This becomes 0x780000000fffffff,

meaning we're short a one here,

so imms is 0x1f, not 0x20.

(how come range_of_ones() uses __ffs64() on the same value?)

but here we put the missing one back,

meaning we pass this check and carry on, (even though 0x780000000fffffff isn't a
legal value)

If I've followed this through correctly, this results in:
|   0:   92457c00        and     x0, x0, #0xf800000007ffffff

... which wasn't the immediate I started with.


Unless I've gone wrong, I think the 'Trim imm to the element size' code needs to
move up into the esz-reducing loop so it doesn't happen for a 64bit immediate.



Thanks,

James
