It still just feels a bit messy and random at places when you go trough
the initial part of the patch series (once we get to the MMIO stuff,
it's all well-structured) so that's the background for my comment.  Oh
well.

yeah, but it's a warning saying "you're VM is messed up, you're probably
in lala land now", so I think you can just get rid of this.

The WARN_ON really means that (a) we have a software BUG, (b) hardware
is broken, or (c) we misread the architecture.  In either case, it's not
about trying to recover gracefully, our job is just to tell the user
that your VM is busted without bringing the whole system down with a
BUG_ON.

The mask covers more bits than the CPUID field, but I think they're RES0
in the spec, and I guess we rely on that here?

yeah, on the head of the list in the vcpu structure, not on the
individual IRQ structs.

I'm not sure if it's measurable, but I generally don't have a feeling
that we have CPU cycles to spare that we need to get rid of:)

The spin_lock inside the loop is what scared me, but you're right that
by far the common case is that the list is empty, so this is most likely
premature.

Not too scared of that, using an atomic counter and given that we have
the queue function, it's one place plus some MMIO handlers that need the
attention.  But yes, we can just fix that later if it makes a
difference, you can leave it for now.
