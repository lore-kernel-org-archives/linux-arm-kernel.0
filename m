Subject: [PATCH 3/6] stm class: provision for statically assigned masterIDs
In-Reply-To: <1454313529-8860-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
References: <1454313529-8860-1-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>
Message-ID: <1454313529-8860-4-git-send-email-zhang.chunyan@linaro.org>

From: Mathieu Poirier <mathieu.poirier@linaro.org>

Some architecture like ARM assign masterIDs statically at the HW design
phase, making masterID manipulation in the generic STM core irrelevant.

This patch adds a new 'mstatic' flag to struct stm_data that tells the
core that this specific STM device doesn't need explicit masterID
management.  In the core sw_start/end of masterID are set to '1',
i.e there is only one masterID to deal with.

Also this patch depends on [1], so that the number of masterID
is '1' too.

Finally the lower and upper bound for masterIDs as presented
in ($SYSFS)/class/stm/XYZ.stm/masters and
($SYSFS)/../stp-policy/XYZ.stm.my_policy/some_device/masters
are set to '-1'.  That way users can't confuse them with
architecture where masterID management is required (where any
other value would be valid).
