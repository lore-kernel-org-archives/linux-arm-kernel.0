To stop adding OABI syscalls altogether.  I'm sure that there will
come a point (if it hasn't already) that glibc no longer supports
OABI, and at that point it probably becomes rather silly to keep
adding OABI syscalls.

The table generation method can be shared, but I've no idea about the
feasibility of sharing the table between ARM64 and ARM - I don't know
enough about ARM64 to know whether things like an "long" argument to
a syscall (which would be 64-bit on ARM64) would be or would not be a
problem if called from a 32-bit user application.

I've zero knowledge of the whole 32-bit application on 64-bit CPUs
thing, so it's pointless trying to discuss this aspect with me.  Even
for x86, all I care there is that it works, I've no knowledge of how
it works.

What's the point of the x32 mode?

Looking through it, sort-of.  It could have re-used the numbering
from the arch/arm include file, but because ARM64 wanted to be an
entirely separate architecture, it duplicates a lot from 32-bit ARM.
I pointed that out at the time, and was shouted down (which is why
today I have absolutely nothing to do with ARM64, and as a result
have very little knowledge about ARM64 - I lost interest in it as
a result of the responses I got to my comments.)

So... if you don't mind, this isn't an issue I care one iota about.

In order for something to work like what you're alluding to, ARM64
would have to ferret around in arch/arm to pull out the bits it
wants, and I see zero reason for that to be acceptable on either
side of the ARM64 vs ARM divide - it will make my job harder because
I'm then into the position where I need acks from ARM64 people to
change ARM code, and that doesn't interest me at all.  I'm not going
to put myself into a position where I'm at the mercy of ARM64 folk.
