The fact that there are some existing issues with building arm64
kernel with clang doesn't sound like a good justification for adding
new issues :)

However in this case I do believe that this is more of a bug in clang
that should be fixed.

Well, I have tried applying that patch and running kvm tests that I
could find [1], and they passed (actually I think there was an issue
with one of them, but I saw the same thing when I tried running them
on a kernel built with GCC).
