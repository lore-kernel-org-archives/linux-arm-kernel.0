When the kernel boots. The OSV guys also have seen this (time going
backward), and this patch seems to have solved their problem.

I definitely see this process happening, but that doesn't seem to be the
problem.

My main problem is that I cannot easily correlate what is happening in
the guest at that time with something touching CNTVCT. That's just odd.

It was first reported by the OSV guys, and I then spotted some
interesting hrtimers taking too long at guest boot time. Putting some
traces quickly identified the issue.
