Subject: [PATCH RESEND] ARM: dts: Fix the sort ordering of EHCI and HSIC in
 rk3288.dtsi
Message-ID: <14819563.gjVG8jMF0E@diego>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

From: Doug Anderson <dianders@chromium.org>

The EHCI and HSIC device tree nodes were added in the wrong place.
Fix them.

Sorry for the double-post. I messed something up when sending the original
which made it look like it came from Doug instead of me.
