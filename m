For what it is worth, I've ran hackbench on my Seattle B0 (8xA57 2GHz),
with a 4 vcpu VM and got the following results (10 runs per kernel
version, same configuration):

v4.4-rc3-wsinc: Average 31.750
32.459
32.124
32.435
31.940
31.085
31.804
31.862
30.985
31.450
31.359

v4.4-rc3: Average 31.954
31.806
31.598
32.697
31.472
31.410
32.562
31.938
31.932
31.672
32.459

This is with GCC as produced by Linaro:
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc (Linaro GCC 5.1-2015.08) 5.1.1 20150608

It could well be that your compiler generates worse code than the one I
use, or that the code it outputs is badly tuned for XGene. I guess I
need to unearth my Mustang to find out...
