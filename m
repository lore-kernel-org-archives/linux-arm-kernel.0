No, that'd be the wrong thing to do. The kernel uses *either* the virt
or phys timer depending on how it has been booted, and both counters are
in use.

What KVM (or any other hypervisor) needs from the timer subsystem is:
- an interrupt (so that it can force a guest exit when the timer fires),
- a way to convert the values programmed into the HW into a timer event
(which is what the time counter structure is for).

That allows the hypervisor to *emulate* a timer for the guest, and
that's what virt/kvm/arm/arch_timer.c is all about. We have a clear
separation of what is driving the HW vs what is emulating it, and I'm
quite eager to preserve that.

At the cost of mandating separate storage in the arm_arch_timer driver.
I do not find that much nicer, but if you prefer that, fine by me.

Thanks,
