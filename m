Trivial nit: for consistency with the rest of the file, there should
only be one line space between options.

... ah, here's the missing #endif from patch 1.

Assuming that gets sorted out, this looks good to me, and works on juno,
so FWIW:

As a future thought (I've scope-creeped this enough with the UXN check),
there are some other checks that we could add, like verifying the AP
bits don't allow user data access. That might be worth considering, with
DEBUG_WX becoming a more general kernel page table sanity check.

Thanks,
Mark.
