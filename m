Note that you are allowed to use a 0 size field. It means 1 bit of
EventID (2 possible interrupts). So maybe using a particular address as
a valid flag?

16bit worth of collections is quite a lot (64k CPUs?). I'd be perfectly
fine with a smaller number, but let's see what people think.

You could, instead of testing all the bits for which you can generate an
LPI, look at the coarse map, which usually uses one bit to represent
something like 64 bits of pending table, and find out what is currently
pending. That's what HW does, but maybe there is no need to do this for
the SW implementation, specially if we have very few LPIs.

Absolutely. Only the ITS can touch that memory.
