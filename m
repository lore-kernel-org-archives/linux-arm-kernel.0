Hi Paolo,

THis is the first pull request for the 4.5 merge window. Not much in
terms of features, but a rewrite of our 64bit world switch, making it
a lot nicer, maintainable, and much more likely to cope with things
like VHE. Also support 16bit VMIDs for systems that need to run that
many VMs concurrently.

I was really hoping that the PMU code would make it this time around,
but it got slightly delayed, and the holiday season didn't help. If
we're lucky enough (read: if all known issues have been addressed), I
may send you another pull request early in the new year.

In the mean time, please pull!

Happy Christmas,

      M.

  arm/arm64: KVM: Detect vGIC presence at runtime (2015-12-18 12:01:58 +0000)

----------------------------------------------------------------
KVM/ARM changes for Linux v4.5

- Complete rewrite of the arm64 world switch in C, hopefully
  paving the way for more sharing with the 32bit code, better
  maintainability and easier integration of new features.
  Also smaller and slightly faster in some cases...
- Support for 16bit VM identifiers
- Various cleanups
