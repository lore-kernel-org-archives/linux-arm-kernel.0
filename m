FWIW, actually compiling code looks something like this:

static inline struct kvm_vcpu *kvm_pmc_to_vcpu(struct kvm_pmc *pmc)
{
	struct kvm_pmu *pmu;
	struct kvm_vcpu_arch *vcpu_arch;

	pmc -= pmc->idx;
	pmu = container_of(pmc, struct kvm_pmu, pmc[0]);
	vcpu_arch = container_of(pmu, struct kvm_vcpu_arch, pmu);
	return container_of(vcpu_arch, struct kvm_vcpu, arch);
}

which amounts to 4 sub instructions.
