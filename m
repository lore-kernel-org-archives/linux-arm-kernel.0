Subject: [PATCH 00/21] arm64: KVM: world switch in C
Message-ID: <1447679519-17888-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Once upon a time, the KVM/arm64 world switch was a nice, clean, lean
and mean piece of hand-crafted assembly code. Over time, features have
crept in, the code has become harder to maintain, and the smallest
change is a pain to introduce. The VHE patches are a prime example of
why this doesn't work anymore.

This series rewrites most of the existing assembly code in C, but keeps
the existing code structure in place (most function names will look
familiar to the reader). The biggest change is that we don't have to
deal with a static register allocation (the compiler does it for us),
we can easily follow structure and pointers, and only the lowest level
is still in assembly code. Oh, and a negative diffstat.

There is still a healthy dose of inline assembly (system register
accessors, runtime code patching), but I've tried not to make it too
invasive. The generated code, while not exactly brilliant, doesn't
look too shaby. I do expect a small performance degradation, but I
believe this is something we can improve over time (my initial
measurements don't show any obvious regression).

Eventually (and assuming people are happy with the general approach
taken here), it should be possible to make the 32bit converge with
this and reuse some parts of the code.

Patches are against 4.4-rc1 (mostly), and I've pushed a branch out
(kvm-arm64/wsinc). This has been tested on Juno, Seattle and the FVP
model. I also have pushed out kvm-arm64/vhe-wsinc that implements VHE
on top of these patches.
