The main issue is that we don't currently have a good story when
returning error in general. The current implementation of the vITS
doesn't implement the stalling behaviour which would give the guest the
opportunity to do something. From a host PoV, I'm not really sure what
we can do. Killing the guest doesn't seem very appropriate.

So I'd rather implement stalling the command queue (see 6.3.2 in the
GICv3 spec), and implement something to report the error (even though
this is IMPDEF). Thoughts?
