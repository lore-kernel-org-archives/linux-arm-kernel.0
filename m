Subject: [PATCH] ARM: dts: rk3036: Fix erroneous SPI bus warnings
Message-ID: <20180913181245.25484-12-robh@kernel.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

dtc has new checks for SPI buses. The rk3036 dts file has a node named
spi' which causes false positive warnings. As the node is a pinctrl child
node, change the node name to be 'spi-pins' to fix the warnings.

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-evb.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #address-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-kylin.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #address-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-evb.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #size-cells for SPI bus
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-kylin.dtb: Warning (spi_bus_bridge): /pinctrl/spi: incorrect #size-cells for SPI bus
