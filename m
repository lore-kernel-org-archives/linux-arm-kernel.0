FWIW, QEMU's modelling approach to this is to say that devices
do *not* generate interrupts on restore. If the device had
previously generated an interrupt then this should be captured
by the state of the interrupt controller (or whatever else
it is connected to) and dealt with when the GIC state is restored.

If you say that restoring the device state is supposed to
generate an interrupt, you introduce an ordering requirement
that the state of the interrupt controller is restored
first and the device second (otherwise the incoming GIC
state will overwrite the interrupt that the device just
generated), which isn't ideal (especially since QEMU
makes no guarantees about restore order between devices).
