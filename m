I am probably missing something here, but let me add that I am not
sure I understand how this patch can be used on ARM/ARM64 systems
so ARM platform idle back-end code annotation is basically useless
given that it is code that can't be preempted anyway (and even if
it could PC range check can even fail given that we may execute some
code with MMU off so out of physical addresses).

What's the purpose of this cpu idle tracking ? Can't it be implemented
in a simpler way (ie RCU API) ?
