Hi Yury,

The general requirement merging ILP32 glibc patches is that LP64 does not regress in any reasonable configuration.  This means that there should be 0 regressions between kvgv and kvge -- i.e., glibc in LP64 mode with and without ILP32 patches does not regress on the vanilla kernel.  The kvge configuration is not in your testing matrix, and I suggest you make sure it has no regressions before fixing the more "advanced" configuration of kege.

Ideally, there should be no regressions between kvgv and kege configurations, but I don't consider this to a requirement for glibc acceptance of ILP32 patches, since any regressions between kvge and kege configurations are likely to be on the kernel side.

Speculating on the kernel requirements for ILP32 kernel patchset, I think there should be 0 regressions between kvgv and kdgv configurations, where you have only 3 tests to investigate and fix.

[I do appreciate that there are progressions in your results as well, but the glibc policy is that they do not offset regressions.]

The above only concerns LP64 support in kernel and glibc.

Regarding ILP32 runtime, my opinion is that it is acceptable for ILP32 to have extra failures compared to LP64, since these are not regressions, but, rather, failures of a new configuration.  From a superficial glance is seems that ILP32 linknamespace support requires attention, as well as stack unwinding (judging from NPTL failures).
