Note that 'disabled' here means 'not implemented it in silicon', so
there is no way you will ever be able to re-enable GICv2 compatibility
on a ThunderX. Another thing to keep in mind is that GICv2
compatibility is disabled on the non-secure side if the secure side
elects to configure its view of the GIC as v3 (i.e., in order to
support >8 cores)
