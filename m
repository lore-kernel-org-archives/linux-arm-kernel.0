Subject: [PATCH 0/8] Fixes to v7 of the vITS save/restore series
Message-ID: <20170508115454.5075-1-cdall@linaro.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

We spotted a number of isses on the v7 ITS save/restore patch series,
but because most of that patch series is in really good shape, and
because the work discussed is somewhat orthogonal (the register iodevs
in particular), I decided to send out a set of fixes to apply after the
main ITS save/restore series, and we can apply the v7 series plus these
fixes.

The whole series with the fixes applied on top of queue can be found here:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cdall/linux.git its-save-restore-queue-fixes

Thanks,
-Christoffer
