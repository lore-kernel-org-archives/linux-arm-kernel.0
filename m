The point worth noting is, PMD (in ARM ARM terms) is always Level 2, 
irrespective of whether it is also PGD(the entry level). So as long as
we deal with PMD or PUD (and not PGD which varies) and make sure you
have sufficient number of levels we are fine.

For PMD it is guaranteed on all architectures and we do that explicitly
for stage2 in arm64 KVM. Similarly for PUD we need to make sure we have
3 levels to use a huge page or else fallback to splitting the pages.

Sure. It is quite easy to confuse ourselves even later when we look at
it. We could put in a big fat comment explaining this to avoid
scratching our heads later.
