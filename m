In the previous patch, kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run return 0 when telling 
userspace about a debug exception. Shouldn't this branch return 0 
instead of 1?

Returning on non-zero for kvm_handle_mmio_return is done because it 
means there was an error. This is not the case for 
kvm_arm_handle_step_debug.

The description in the comment of kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run is not very 
clear whether non-zero result should be used for errors or if only the 
negative values are treated as such, and positive values seems to be 
generally used to keep the vcpu going. So, I thought it might make sense 
to always return the same value upon debug exceptions.

Cheers,
