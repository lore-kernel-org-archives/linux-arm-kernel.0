So I did ponder making this a bool, returning true if we need to exit
and testing in v/k/a/arm.c exit leg rather than in the mmio handler.

At the moment it mirrors the existing exit logic which follows -1 err, 0
return, >0 handled. But as I mentioned in the cover letter this fell
down a bit when dealing with the mmio case.

I wanted to keep the debug suffix so that's fine although I'm not so
sure trap is correct because on the tail end of mmio emulation are we
still trapping?

Maybe kvm_arm_step_emulated_debug?
