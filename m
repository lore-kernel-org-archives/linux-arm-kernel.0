Subject: [PATCH v4 0/8] arm64: Privileged Access Never using TTBR0_EL1
 switching
Message-ID: <1477675636-3957-1-git-send-email-catalin.marinas@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This is the fourth version of the arm64 PAN emulation using TTBR0_EL1
switching. The series does not include the empty_zero_page patch from
Ard B. as I didn't have an up to date patch, nor figured out where the
discussion was left.

The patches are available on this branch:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux ttbr0-pan

Changes since v3:

- Xen hyp call now only enables TTBR0_EL1 if needed without clearing PAN

- Fix for user space cache maintenance trapping/emulation

- Simplified asm macros based on Mark R's "alternative_else_nop_endif"

- Separate patch for fixing the synchronous external abort description

- #includes clean-up

Catalin Marinas (8):
  arm64: Update the synchronous external abort fault description
  arm64: Factor out PAN enabling/disabling into separate uaccess_*
    macros
  arm64: Factor out TTBR0_EL1 post-update workaround into a specific asm
    macro
  arm64: Introduce uaccess_{disable,enable} functionality based on
    TTBR0_EL1
  arm64: Disable TTBR0_EL1 during normal kernel execution
  arm64: Handle faults caused by inadvertent user access with PAN
    enabled
  arm64: xen: Enable user access before a privcmd hvc call
  arm64: Enable CONFIG_ARM64_SW_TTBR0_PAN
