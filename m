Heh :) I meant reordering only this field if it is changed.

If you want me to reorder the whole structure and remove all holes...

Patches of that sort (I mean moving fields here and there just to save
couple of bytes) are looking weird. At most because there is general
assumption that the hole exists because author prefers to have clean
logic in field order even with the cost of few holes. But if you give
me indulgence...

Nevertheless, for this specific structure:
Before:
/* size: 8176, cachelines: 128, members: 23 */
/* sum members: 8152, holes: 3, sum holes: 10 */
/* padding: 14 */
/* last cacheline: 48 bytes */

After:
/* size: 8160, cachelines: 128, members: 23 */
/* padding: 8 */
/* last cacheline: 32 bytes */

The patch is below.
