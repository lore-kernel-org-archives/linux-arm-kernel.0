I won't argue about code aesthetics (although I disagree here :-). I will
point out that in this case the compiler will no doubt do the right thing,
as vcpu_sys_reg() is just a macro, but for a pointer taking function in
general there would be potential to get both calls emitted, as the
compiler wouldn't be sure there would be no side effect.

OK
