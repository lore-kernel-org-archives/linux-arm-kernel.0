Are vcpu ids already exposed to userspace (beyond the stupid
KVM_IRQ_LINE) ioctl and as such we're bound to whatever upper limit and
format they have?

If not, I think decoupling an internal ID and uniquely identifying a CPU
is a good idea.

I think the only things that should matter here are (in no particular
order):
 - Userspace convenience
 - Clarity
 - Avoiding ambiguity

For the GIC, I think we've discussed this in the past.  It really
depends whether you think about the GIC as one device (the distributor)
separate from the CPUs, with a bunch of separate devices attached to
each CPU and wired together somehow, or if you think of this as one big
coherent thing where parts of the device are specific to each CPU.

I tend to interpret the GIC as the latter and I think the kernel and
userspace implementations are also done that way, suggesting we should
stick with the device API for all GIC-related state (as was also the
suggestion for the GICv3 save/restore API).

Similarly, because the GIC architecture refers to CPUs using the MPIDR,
we should do the same in this interface.  Otherwise, I think you have to
define stricly how the exposed VCPU ID maps to an MPIDR somehow.
