Subject: [PATCH v2 0/5] generic early_ioremap support
Message-ID: <1389062120-31896-1-git-send-email-msalter@redhat.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

This patch series takes the common bits from the x86 early ioremap
implementation and creates a generic implementation which may be used
by other architectures. The early ioremap interfaces are intended for
situations where boot code needs to make temporary virtual mappings
before the normal ioremap interfaces are available. Typically, this
means before paging_init() has run.

These patches are layered on top of generic fixmap patches which
were discussed here (and are in the akpm tree):

  http://lkml.org/lkml/2013/11/25/474

This is version 2 of the patch series. These patches (and underlying
fixmap patches) may be found at:

  git://github.com/mosalter/linux.git (early-ioremap-v2 branch)

Changes from version 1:

  * Moved the generic code into linux/mm instead of linux/lib

  * Have early_memremap() return normal pointer instead of __iomem
    This is in response to sparse warning cleanups being made in
    an unrelated patch series:

        https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/12/22/69

  * Added arm64 patch to call init_mem_pgprot() earlier so that
    the pgprot macros are valid in time for early_ioremap use

  * Added validity checking for early_ioremap pgd, pud, and pmd
    in arm64

Mark Salter (5):
  mm: create generic early_ioremap() support
  x86: use generic early_ioremap
  arm: add early_ioremap support
  arm64: initialize pgprot info earlier in boot
  arm64: add early_ioremap support
