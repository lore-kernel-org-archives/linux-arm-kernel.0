Subject: [RFC 0/3] arm64: Realtek RTD1295 RTC
Message-ID: <20170820013632.18375-1-afaerber@suse.de>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org

Hello,

This series adds the RTC for the Realtek RTD1295 SoC.
Based on my RTD1295 clk series.

There being no public source code for RTD1295, the implementation is based on
register offsets seen in the vendor DT, as well as older mach-rtk119x code
published by QNAP.

The base year is hardcoded - probably should be a DT property like downstream?

The DT node depends on the clk series for clock index and header.

More experimental patches at:
https://github.com/afaerber/linux/commits/rtd1295-next

Have a lot of fun!

Cheers,
Andreas
