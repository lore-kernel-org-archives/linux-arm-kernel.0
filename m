Subject: [PATCH v8 02/20] KVM: ARM64: Define PMU data structure for each vcpu
In-Reply-To: <1450771695-11948-1-git-send-email-zhaoshenglong@huawei.com>

From: Shannon Zhao <shannon.zhao@linaro.org>

Here we plan to support virtual PMU for guest by full software
emulation, so define some basic structs and functions preparing for
futher steps. Define struct kvm_pmc for performance monitor counter and
struct kvm_pmu for performance monitor unit for each vcpu. According to
ARMv8 spec, the PMU contains at most 32(ARMV8_MAX_COUNTERS) counters.

Since this only supports ARM64 (or PMUv3), add a separate config symbol
for it.
