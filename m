Well, the helper is generic and its just that KVM makes use of it.

I could rearrange them a bit to :

	case 4: ..
#ifdef CONFIG_ARM64_PA_BITS_52
	case 6: ...
#endif
	case 5:
	/* Report 48 bit if the kernel doesn't support 52bit */
	default: return 48;

Yes, I think that might be a bit cleaner.

As mentioned in the other thread, I will change the name of the helper.

The parange holds the PARange initially, used to set the VTCR.IPS and is then
overloaded with the converted "phys-shift". The change is a minor cleanup to
make that clear, even though we remove it later as we don't deal with the
phys-shifts anymore. I would prefer to keep it as it is.
