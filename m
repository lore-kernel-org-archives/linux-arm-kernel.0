If the guest CPU doesn't support the RAS extension then we have
no mechanism for delivering it a notification about the
memory problem at all, so setting the syndrome to anything
doesn't make sense.

I'm not sure what you should do in the case of "host
supports telling us about a memory problem and has
done so, but guest does not support being told about it",
but I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be this.
