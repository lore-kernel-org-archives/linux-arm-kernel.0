I don't think it's 100% unreasonable to potentially imagine independent
updates of parts of the register when the spec explicitly says this is
allowed.

I agree, that it would be a curious guest (and I raised this point once
already), but I think relying on this is a terrible approach to
emulating hardware and without any comment or anything in the kernel
saying 'this is safe and reasonable because of so and so' it just looks
too dodgy for me to live with.
