The only other place I found is KVM_CREATE_VCPU. I suppose we could move
to MPIDR for that, and it would be a nice way to handle the "userspace
determines MPIDR" work that I plan to do. Both KVM and its userspaces
would still use some counter-based vcpu identifiers internally, to avoid
large, sparse structures, but I guess the advantage is that they don't
have to agree on how they do that. The 'vcpu id' used by KVM_CREATE_VCPU
is already 32-bits, and is supposed to be an arbitrary identifier. That
all looks good for converting to MPIDR.

Agreed. I believe the counter-based vcpu-id brings the most convenience
for any non-MPIDR based APIs, i.e. no spec saying MPIDR should be used.
However, picking which counter-based vcpu-id (if more than one exist)
costs both convenience and clarity. I guess that's another argument for
switching to MPIDR...

I keep flip-flopping my view, which is why I keep flip-flopping my
opinion on how to deal with its register API :-)

I think the save/restore case is where I always flip to seeing it as a
bunch of separate per cpu devices. It would feel better to me to
save/restore the cpu-gic registers the same way we do all other cpu
registers.

I think we can get the best of both worlds by extending the
SET/GET_DEVICE_ATTR to vcpus, and then using both the device ioctl
and the vcpu ioctls.

Well, we're creating our own interface to a gic model, so there's
nothing in the spec that says MPIDR is needed here, but if there's
no good reason not to change the KVM_CREATE_VCPU vcpu-id to MPIDR,
then we certainly wouldn't want to invent a new vcpu-id for this use.


My current feelings are:
  1) avoid needing vcpu identifiers (use vcpu ioctl whenever possible)
  2) if we need them, they should match the same one used by
     KVM_CREATE_VCPU (whenever possible)
  3) any device api that doesn't provide a 32-bit identifier field
     should just be special-cased, and have plenty of documentation
     explaining how to handle it - explaining what other limitations
     it puts on the guest, etc.

None of those feelings exclude using MPIDR as _the_ vcpu-id (I don't
think). It appears the main benefit of switching to MPIDR would be to
decouple KVM from its userspaces wrt to choosing the non-MPIDR vcpu
identification used for managing data structures and looping over
vcpus internally. We also gain a clean way for userspace to choose
the MPIDR for each vcpu, which we need to do anyway.

Thanks,
