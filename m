Subject: [PATCH v3 28/30] ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: add support for the thermal
 sensor in A83T
In-Reply-To: <20180830154518.29507-1-embed3d@gmail.com>

To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

As we have gained the support for the thermal sensor in A83T,
we can now add its device nodes to the device tree.

The A83T seems to have a broken IRQ 31, thus we use here IRQ 41.
