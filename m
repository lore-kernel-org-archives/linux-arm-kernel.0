Subject: [PATCH v2 2/8] arm/arm64: KVM: arch_timer: Only schedule soft timer
 on vcpu_block
In-Reply-To: <1441395650-19663-1-git-send-email-christoffer.dall@linaro.org>

We currently schedule a soft timer every time we exit the guest if the
timer did not expire while running the guest.  This is really not
necessary, because the only work we do in the timer work function is to
kick the vcpu.

Kicking the vcpu does two things:
(1) If the vpcu thread is on a waitqueue, make it runnable and remove it
from the waitqueue.
(2) If the vcpu is running on a different physical CPU from the one
doing the kick, it sends a reschedule IPI.

The second case cannot happen, because the soft timer is only ever
scheduled when the vcpu is not running.  The first case is only relevant
when the vcpu thread is on a waitqueue, which is only the case when the
vcpu thread has called kvm_vcpu_block().

Therefore, we only need to make sure a timer is scheduled for
kvm_vcpu_block(), which we do by encapsulating all calls to
kvm_vcpu_block() with kvm_timer_{un}schedule calls.

Additionally, we only schedule a soft timer if the timer is enabled and
unmasked, since it is useless otherwise.

Note that theoretically userspace can use the SET_ONE_REG interface to
change registers that should cause the timer to fire, even if the vcpu
is blocked without a scheduled timer, but this case was not supported
before this patch and we leave it for future work for now.
