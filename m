Subject: [PATCH v10 00/18] KVM: arm64: Optimise FPSIMD context switching
Message-ID: <1527005119-6842-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Note: Most of these patches are Arm-specific.  People not Cc'd on the
whole series can find it in the linux-arm-kernel archive [2].

This series aims to improve the way FPSIMD context is handled by KVM.
Changes since the previous v9 [1] are mostly minor, but there are some
fixes worthy of closer attention.

In addition to addressing a review comment by Marc on the changes in v9,
this series attempts to fix a NULL-dereference bug observed by Marc on
ESPRESSOBin [5].  A reproducer for a similar bug is documented in [6],
and this series fixes the observed bug (in patches 1 and 7).  At the
moment, this is my best hypothesis for the ESPRESSOBin failure, though
the relationship is unproven and we have no reproducer for the latter.

The changes are summarised in the individual patches.

Reviewers please note:

 * Since v8, patches 10 and 14 have changed.  Reviewer tags have been
   stripped from patch 14, due to non-trivial changes in v9 of the
   series: see the patch for details.

 * Since v9, patches 1 and 7 are also new, and correct a latent bug in
   FPSIMD context handling which is exposed by this series.

If people could take a close look at the above patches, that would be
much appreciated.

Cheers
