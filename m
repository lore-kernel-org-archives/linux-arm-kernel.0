I got a bit confused here so ignore this. (I thought it would be useful to
measure from the KVM host perspective, the host-only time of the KVM guest,
which I incorrectly thought could also be the exclude_hv flag. Though I
forgot that 'perf stat -e instructions:H kvmtask' from the host should be
equivalent to 'perf stat -e instructions:h' from the guest.)

You can. (I was assuming you could use exclude_hv from KVM host to measure
all the KVM guest overheads - but you would need to know which tasks are
KVM tasks such that you can consider their EL1 time - again ignore this).

I was considering how we support exclude_hv from a KVM guest. If we count
only EL2 for HV then we are not measuring the true overhead, we also need
to include the EL1 time from the KVM host process when on !VHE.

An immediate guest = the host's guest but not a guest-guest or further
(Apologies if I'm making this up as I go along).

This is what I had in mind. I think we're aligned despite nomenclature
confusing me.

I think we need to:

 - Add support in KVM guests for exclude_hv.

 - Prevent !exclude_hv from returning a count when is is not a guest
   on a !VHE kernel.

I'm not really clear how we implement the second point. We want to count
EL2 (because that would represent a HV) but only when it is a guest. How
does it know it's a guest? (Is it a guest when it's not a KVM host?).
I'm struggling to see how we update the logic in armv8pmu_set_event_filter
(whilst keeping in mind that we want it to write ARMV8_PMU_INCLUDE_EL2
such that when it's a guest the KVM PMU emulation code can use that to
know to do something different).
