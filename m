I'm working on a PoC of a QEMU/KVM cache maintenance approach now.
Hopefully I'll send it out this evening. Tomorrow at the latest.
Getting numbers of that approach vs. a guest's use of cached memory
for devices would take a decent amount of additional work, so won't
be part of that post. I'm actually not sure we should care about
the numbers for a guest using normal mem attributes for device
memory - other than out of curiosity. For correctness this issue
really needs to be solved 100% host-side. We can't rely on a
guest to do different/weird things, just because it's a guest.
Ideally guests don't even know that they're guests. (Even if we
describe the memory as cache-able to the guest, I don't think we
can rely on the guest believing us.)
