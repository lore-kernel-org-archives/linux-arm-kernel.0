  arm64: dts: rockchip: fix include reference (2017-05-19 14:12:00 +0200)

----------------------------------------------------------------
ARM: SoC fixes (and a cross-arch dt-include fix)

We had a small batch of fixes before -rc1, but here is a larger one. It
contains a backmerge of 4.12-rc1 since some of the downstream branches we
merge had that as base; at the same time we already had merged contents
before -rc1 and rebase wasn't the right solution.

A mix of random smaller fixes and a few things worth pointing out:

 - We've started telling people to avoid cross-tree shared branches if all
   they're doing is picking up one or two DT-used constants from a
   shared include file, and instead to use the numeric values on first
   submission. Follow-up moving over to symbolic names are sent in right
   after -rc1, i.e. here. It's only a few minor patches of this type.

 - Linus Walleij and others are resurrecting the 'Gemini' platform, and
   wanted a cut-down platform-specific defconfig for it. So I picked that
   up for them.

 - Rob Herring ran 'savedefconfig' on arm64, it's a bit churny but it helps
   people to prepare patches since it's a pain when defconfig and current
   savedefconfig contents differs too much.

 - Devicetree additions for some pinctrl drivers for Armada that were
   merged this window. I'd have preferred to see those earlier but it's not
   a huge deail.

The biggest change worth pointing out though since it's touching other
parts of the tree: We added prefixes to be used when cross-including
DT contents between arm64 and arm, allowing someone to #include
<arm/foo.dtsi> from arm64, and likewise. As part of that, we needed
arm/foo.dtsi to work on arm as well. The way I suggested this to Heiko
resulted in a recursive symlink.

Instead, I've now moved it out of arch/*/boot/dts/include, into a shared
location under scripts/dtc. While I was at it, I consolidated so all
architectures now behave the same way in this manner.

Rob Herring (DT maintainer) has acked it. I cc:d most other arch
maintainers but nobody seems to care much; it doesn't really affect them
since functionality is unchanged for them by default.
