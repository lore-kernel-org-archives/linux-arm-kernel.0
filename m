Subject: [PATCH v3 0/8] ARM: KVM: Support for vgic-v3
Message-ID: <1473350810-10857-1-git-send-email-vladimir.murzin@arm.com>

Hi,

This is an attempt to make use vgic-v3 under arch/arm since
save-restore functionality got re-written in C and can be shared
between arm/arm64 like it has already been done for vgic-v2 and timer.

With this patches I'm able to get 32 core an AArch32 ARMv8 guest boot:

...
GICv3: CPU31: found redistributor 703 region 0:0x000000003ffd0000
CPU31: thread -1, cpu 3, socket 7, mpidr 80000703
Brought up 32 CPUs
SMP: Total of 32 processors activated (768.00 BogoMIPS).
CPU: All CPU(s) started in SVC mode.
...

Additionally, quite lightweight test based on Self IPI guest test[1]
has been run with up to 255 cpus.

Changelog:

    v2 -> v3
       - rebased on v4.8-rc5
       - commit messages are reworked to be more precise and clear (I
         hope so)
       - MPIDR_HWID_BITMASK is used to discard Aff3 in
         MPIDR_AFFINITY_LEVEL macro
       - cast to u64 is used instead of abuse of GENMASK_ULL while
         building value for typer register
       - static keys are used to select GIC backend
       - config option to guard ITS code is moved to separate patch

    v1 -> v2
       - rebased on v4.8-rc2
       - introduced guard for ITS code

Thanks!
