Setting the boolean here means that the interrupt should be marked
active at the distributor level when the interrupt is injected. This
also allows the timer code to find out when we can inject another
interrupt (by checking that the interrupt is now inactive).

As for the BUG_ON(), this is really some debug stuff to make sure we
have a consistent state.

Non-shared devices are handled separately (and setting the active state
doesn't make much sense, as we expect this to be entirely HW driven).

Do you see anything I should add to make it more clear?

Exactly. This is effectively what the MASK state was doing, now
replicated in SW...
