Subject: [PATCH v2 0/2] arm/arm64: KVM: Optimize arm64 fp/simd,
 saves 30-50% on exits

Currently we save/restore fp/simd on each exit. Fist  patch optimizes arm64 
save/restore, we only do so on Guest access. hackbench and
several lmbench tests show anywhere from 30% to above 50% optimzation
achieved.

In second patch 32-bit handler is updated to keep exit handling consistent 
with 64-bit code.

Changes since v1:
- Addressed Marcs comments
- Verified optimization improvements with lmbench and hackbench, updated 
  commit message

Mario Smarduch (2):
  Optimize arm64 skip 30-50% vfp/simd save/restore on exits
  keep arm vfp/simd exit handling in sync with arm64
