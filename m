Sorry to muddy the waters on this, if you and Dave are sure that
you have the right fix, down in your architectures, and that fix
isn't going to hurt your performance significantly.

But this issue would affect other architectures too, wouldn't it?
I think not just mips, which was mentioned, but others too, parisc
for example: linux-arch Cc'ed.

And I'm not certain that down in the arch is the right place:
it may well turn out to be right, but that's not obvious.  

How much is this issue peculiar to swap?  Where Nitin discovered it
in do_swap_page(), due to swap cache being freed before reaching the
update_mmu_cache().

If it is peculiar to swap, then I'd suggest perhaps one of two very
different solutions.  One would be to rearrange do_swap_page() so we
do not remove the page from swap cache before the update_mmu_cache()
(that would need care, and might turn out to be harder than I think).
The alternative solution might be to stop page_mapping(page) returning
the pseudo-address_space swapper_space when PageSwapCache - I always
hated that, but had to give in at the time.

(Aside: I don't think it affects this issue, but just be aware
that mapping_mapped(page) returns false on a swapcache page,
no matter whether it's mapped in anywhere or not.)

But if it is not peculiar to swap, fixes down in the architecture
may be inevitable.  I think this depends on what happens when
truncating or unmapping a file.  It used to be the case that pages
were unmapped first, then truncated (clearing page->mapping) after:
in which case, Nitin's issue would appear to be peculiar to swap.

But around 2.6.23 Nick found a second unmap_mapping_range() necessary
after the truncation (just for the invalidation case? or because of
inadequate serialization, now I think fixed with the page lock?).
And I think he has that area under reconstruction again at present,
so Cc'ed for his opinion on this issue - thanks.

Hugh
