Subject: [PATCH 20/20] arm/arm64: Add hyp-stub API documentation
In-Reply-To: <20170217154429.5000-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
References: <20170217154429.5000-1-marc.zyngier@arm.com>

List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

In order to help people understanding the hyp-stub API that exists
between the host kernel and the hypervisor mode (whether a hypervisor
has been installed or not), let's document said API.

As as with any form of documentation, I expect it to become obsolete
and completely misleading within 20 minutes after having being merged.

+* Internal ABI between the kernel and HYP
+
+This file documents the interaction between the Linux kernel and the
+hypervisor layer when running Linux as a hypervisor (for example
+KVM). It doesn't cover the interaction of the kernel with the
+hypervisor when running as a guest (under Xen, KVM or any other
+hypervisor), or any hypervisor-specific interaction when the kernel is
+used as a host.
+
+On arm and arm64 (without VHE), the kernel doesn't run in hypervisor
+mode, but still needs to interact with it, allowing a built-in
+hypervisor to be either installed or torn down.
+
+In order to achieve this, the kernel must be booted at HYP (arm) or
+EL2 (arm64), allowing it to install a set of stubs before dropping to
+SVC/EL1. These stubs are accessible by using a 'hvc #0' instruction,
+and only act on individual CPUs.
+
+Unless specified otherwise, any built-in hypervisor must implement
+these functions (see arch/arm{,64}/include/asm/virt.h):
+
+* r0/x0 = HVC_GET_VECTORS
+
+  Return the current value of HVBAR/VBAR_EL2 in r0/x0.
+
+* r0/x0 = HVC_SET_VECTORS
+  r1/x1 = vectors
+
+  Set HVBAR/VBAR_EL2 to 'vectors' to enable a hypervisor. Only
+  implemented by the initial stubs.
+
+* r0/x0 = HVC_RESET_VECTORS
+
+  Turn HYP/EL2 MMU off, and reset HVBAR/VBAR_EL2 to the default
+  value. This effectively disables an existing hypervisor.
+
+* r0/x0 = HVC_SOFT_RESTART
+  r1/x1 = restart address
+  x2 = x0's value when entering the next payload (arm64)
+  x3 = x1's value when entering the next payload (arm64)
+  x4 = x2's value when entering the next payload (arm64)
+
+  Mask all exceptions, disable the MMU, move the arguments into place
+  (arm64 only), and jump to the restart address while at HYP/EL2. This
+  hypercall is not expected to return to its caller.
+
+Any other value of r0/x0 triggers a hypervisor-specific handling,
+which is not documented here.
