Thanks for the additional explanation. I've finally got my head wrapped
around this and it looks good to me. And, I see now that my comment about
verify_local_cpu_errata_workarounds() only applies to CPUs plugged after
boot. The comment in check_local_cpu_capabilities() states clearly each
CPU present at boot gets a chance to update cpu_hwcaps - which also
clarifies why kvm_map_vectors() *must* use cpus_have_const_cap(), else
risk the el2 vector slot not being allocated.

Thanks,
drew
