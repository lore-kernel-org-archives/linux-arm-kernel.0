I assumed that in plain terms, the difference between MT_DEVICE and
MT_UNCACHED is write posting (aka bufferable) behaviour (across CPU
architecture versions) and that does not affect write ordering rules.

You and Catalin have more insights into ARM 32-bit memory types so
I definitely need your input here to be comprehensive and avoid
pitfalls, let me know if you have some specific CPUs in mind on
which this may trigger a regression.

Thank you !
