Yes, if a table straddles a page boundary (the spec doesn't seem to
disallow this). We might not map all of the required pages, e.g.

* If the kernel was loaded more than TEXT_OFFSET bytes above the table
  (the arm64 linear/direct mapping is currently tied to our text
  mapping, and we can't currently address anything below that).

  In this case the start isn't in the direct mapping, and we'll try to
  create a new mapping. That should work.

* If the kernel is built with a small VA range, and we have just the
  right amount of memory before the table begins (this is absurdly
  unlikely).

  In this case if the start is in the direct mapping, but the end isn't,
  we'll explode when accessing it.

* If the 'mem=' parameter is used, the direct mapping can be truncated.

  In this case if the start is in the direct mapping, but the end isn't,
  we'll explode when accessing it.

In the arm64 ioremap_cache we only check
pfn_valid(__phys_to_pfn(phys_addr)), and assume that if the start was
mapped, then the whole region is. In the cases above that's clearly not
true, so we should probably see about handling that.

I believe it's too early, as we haven't initialised the memmap yet. For
the cases above we will never have a page for the portion of the region
not in the direct mapping anyway.

That sounds good to me.

As mentioned above, I think we should test that the entire region we're
trying to map falls within the direct mapping before assuming we can use
it, though I'm not sure what the best way of doing that is.

Thanks,
Mark.
