I see what you mean we can't use cycle based accounting to accrue
Guest time.

Yes if only ticks are supported then it's definitely better!

Nevertheless with high interrupt rate it will complicate root causing
issues, a lot of that time will go to guest.

I may be missing something, but on return from interrupt with preempt
disabled we can't take the need resched path. And need to return
to KVM no?

I think something to look into for us, taking a low issue to high level
application - for state machine based type of applications (I guess like
NFV) it cause problems  to root cause issues, a lot of activities
run between ticks. For VM cycle based accounting is probably a must
in that case.
