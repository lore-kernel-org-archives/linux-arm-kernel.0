Hi Marc,

this series is mostly obsolete now, but I wanted to elaborate on the
locking scheme, which hasn't changed.

Does QUIESCENT actually cover the command queue status? I was under the
impression that this is purely to cope with distributed implementations
and the possible delays caused by propagating commands.
If not so, I can surely take the lock here and respect
(creadr == cwriter) upon setting the bit.

How so? Clearly we keep the number of VCPUs constant, so everything
guest visible stays the same even upon migrating to a much different
host? Or are we talking about different things here?

I couldn't stuff "42" in 4 bits, so: yes ;-)

I guess I was halfway undecided between going with the pure
architectural requirements (which only mandate bits 7:4 in PIDR2) and
complying with the recommendation later in the spec.
So I will just fill PIDR0, PIDR2 and the rest of PIDR2 as well.

Agreed.

I don't think so, because we "return 0;" above if the ITS is enabled,
which means that nothing is going on at the moment.
But I guess I can just take the lock anyway to be sure.

OK, here you go: Actually we are handling the command queue
synchronously: The first writer to CWRITER will end up here and will
iterate over all commands below. From the guests point of view it will
take some time to do the CWRITER MMIO write, but upon the writel
returning the queue is actually already empty again.
That means that any _sane_ guest will _never_ trigger the case where two
threads/VCPUs are handling the queue, because a concurrent write to
CWRITER without a lock in the guest would be broken by design.

However I am not sure we can rely on this, so I added this precaution
scheme:
The first writer takes our ITS (emulation) lock and examines cwriter and
creadr to see if they are equal. If they are, then the queue is
currently empty, which means we are the first one and need to take care
of the commands. We update our copy of cwriter (now marking the queue as
non-empty) and drop the lock. As we kept the queue-was-empty status in a
local variable, we now can start iterating through the queue. We only
take the lock briefly when really needed in this process (for instance
when one command has been processed and creadr is incremented).

If now a second VCPU writes CWRITER, we also take the lock and compare
creadr and cwriter. Now they are different, because the first thread is
still busy with handling the commands and hasn't finished yet.
So we set our local "finished" to true. Also we update cwriter to the
new value, then drop the lock. The while loop below will not be entered
in this thread and we return to the guest.
Now the first thread has handled another command, takes the lock to
increase creadr and compares it with cwriter. Without the second writer
it may have been finished already, but now cwriter has grown, so it will
just carry on with handling the commands.

A bit like someone washing the dishes while another person adds some
more dirty plates to the pile ;-)

But again: this is just insurance against broken guests and due to guest
locking requirements this would actually never happen.

Does that make sense?

Btw: I have finished rebasing this upon the new VGIC and will post a new
version after -rc1.

Cheers,
Andre.
