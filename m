It's fine to return error codes, but at the very least we should have a
comment saying "We throw away all errors because we cannot handle them
and this is always fine to do, because of X".

I feel like a -ENOMEM should be reported back to userspace so we can
give up on our giant resource hogging VM instead of just grinding on.

Isn't this all done as part of a MMIO write, so you can return the error
from that thing?

If you were running this in a separate thread, it would be an entirely
more difficult matter.
