Aside from the no_resched() thing which Steven already explained and my
previous email asking why you need the preempt_disable() at all, that
should indeed work.

The reason I was asking was that I wasn't sure you weren't doing:

  spin_lock(&my_lock);
  error = copy_to_user();
  spin_unlock(&my_lock);

and expecting the copy_to_user() to always take the exception table
route. This works on mainline (since spin_lock implies a preempt disable
and preempt_disable is the same as pagefault_disable). However as should
be clear by now, it doesn't quite work that way for -rt.
