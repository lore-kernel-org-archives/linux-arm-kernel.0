That is more a factor of who shows interest and is active on
the uclinux-dev mailing list more than anything else though.
Quite of few different groups of people interested in non-MMU
ARM platforms have shown up over the years, but none seem to stay
active for long.

Yes, highly encourage this.

I used to keep one on git.kernel.org for promoting non-architectural
but non-MMU specific changes to mainline.

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/gerg/uclinux.git;a=summary

But I have had so few changes that fit in that category that I
haven't used it in quite a while.
