This should most probably be a bool, together with the in_bounds variable.

It's the morning, and I haven't had much coffee, but this looks 
confusing as hell. Most of the reasoning here is done in terms of 
addresses, and you're now mixing it with a different unit, making the 
result more unreadable.

I find it easier to read it as:

 	}
 	up_read(&current->mm->mmap_sem);
 
which is of course completely untested.

Thanks,
