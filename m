Subject: [PATCH v5 00/14] KVM: arm64: Optimise FPSIMD context switching
Message-ID: <1525449935-31424-1-git-send-email-Dave.Martin@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

Note: Most of these patches are Arm-specific.  People not Cc'd on the
whole series can find it in the linux-arm-kernel archive [3].

This series aims to improve the way FPSIMD context is handled by KVM,
building on the previous RFC v4 [1].

Patches 1-2 are picked from a separate RFC series [2] since they
introduce a helper I wanted to use here.


The main changes since RFC v4 are:

 * Rebased to -rc3.

 * Patches 1-2 pulled into series from [2], and other patches modified
   to use it.

 * Redundant additions by patch 3 that were reverted by other patches
   are now gone.

 * New patches 12-14 move the call to __hyp_switch_fpsimd() out of asm
   completely, moving it to the fixup_guest_exit() path instead.  This
   should significantly cleaner, but does add a bit of overhead to
   FPSIMD trapping.

   This is presented as an independent change in case people want to
   benchmark with/without.


Other minor changes as noted.


Some testing done on Juno and the Arm fast model (arm64), including
combinations of (non-)SVE and (non-)VHE configurations.

Cheers
