Thanks, Mark! Agree about KCOV, I'll switch it off for that file.

And I think I should _not_ disable UBSAN for that file. I didn't make any
intentional UB, so if UBSAN finds anything, that will be a true positive report.

Yes, indeed. That's why I check against that, please see BUG_ON() in
erase_kstack() for x86.

1. Calculate the boundary from the lowest_stack.
2. Search for poison between lowest_stack and boundary.
3. Now ready to write the poison.
4. Reset the boundary to current_stack_pointer if we are on the thread stack and
to current_top_of_stack otherwise (we are on the trampoline stack).
5. BUG_ON(boundary - p >= THREAD_SIZE);
6. Write poison till the boundary.

We switch to the trampoline stack from the current thread stack just before
returning to the userspace. Please search for "trampoline stack" in
arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S.

Mark, thank you for such an important remark!

In Kconfig STACKLEAK implies but doesn't depend on VMAP_STACK. In fact x86_32
doesn't have VMAP_STACK at all but can have STACKLEAK.

[Adding Andy Lutomirski]

I've made some additional experiments: I exhaust the thread stack to have only
(MIN_STACK_LEFT - 1) bytes left and then force alloca. If VMAP_STACK is
disabled, BUG_ON() handling causes stack depth overflow, which is detected by
SCHED_STACK_END_CHECK. If VMAP_STACK is enabled, the kernel hangs on BUG_ON()
handling! Enabling CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING gives the needed report from VMAP_STACK:

I can't say why VMAP_STACK report hangs during BUG_ON() handling on defconfig.
Andy, can you give a clue?

I see that MIN_STACK_LEFT = 2048 is enough for BUG_ON() handling on both x86_64
and x86_32. So I'm going to:
 - set MIN_STACK_LEFT to 2048;
 - improve the lkdtm test to cover this case.

Mark, Kees, Laura, does it sound good?

Thanks for the details. This quite old article [1] says:
  The code run in HYP mode is limited to a few hundred instructions and isolated
  to two assembly files: arch/arm/kvm/interrupts.S and arch/arm/kvm/interrupts_head.S.

Is all hyp code now localized in arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/?
