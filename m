ADM Box mode is a interleaved type of DMA where data from rows of equal 
length and equal distance(bytes) between each other are transferred to 
similar pattern of rows.
Each row length and distance between each row in destination pattern may 
not be equal to source pattern.
Distance between beginning of any two rows are always greater than row 
length.
Example:
If 4 rows of 16 bytes each are arranged such that distance between 
beginning of any two rows are 32 bytes.
Now they can be transferred using BOX mode to destination pattern 
arranged in 2 rows of 32 bytes each and distance between them can be any 
lets say 128 bytes.

Source pattern:
4 data rows starts address 0th byte.

0-----16-bytes-data-----15
16    16 bytes void     31
32---------data---------47
48         void         63
64---------data---------79
80         void         95
96---------data--------111

Transferred to destination
Destination pattern:
2 rows
0----------32-bytes-data----------31
32         96 bytes void         127
128-------------data-------------159
