So for the records: we can't use the macro here, since it relies on
masking and thus a certain alignment, which the SGIPENDR registers do
not have (being mapped to 0xF10 and 0xF20, respectively). So the
calculated intid would be much higher than the number of actually
allocated interrupts - with all the consequences ;-)

Cheers,
Andre.
