I was suggesting that it's always true after this patch.

Consistent with what?  Without more context or explanation,
I'm not sure what the reader is to make of that.  Do you not mean the
TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is always true for kernel threads?

I'm struggling with the "As a result," here.  Is this because reloads of
regs in ret_to_user (or sigreturn) are the only places that can make
wrong_cpu or wrong_task be false?

(I'm actually wanting to understand this, not just bikeshedding the
commit message, as new corner cases keep coming up on this logic.)

nit: funny formatting

nit: ensuring that TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE *remains* set whenever a kernel
thread is scheduled in?

If you can slightly connect the dots with the "As a result" above, I'm
fine with your version of the text.
