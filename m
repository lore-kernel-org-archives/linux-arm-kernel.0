Is this at kernel boot time you see this, or at system startup time?

IIRC, QEMU creates a throw-away VM with the default CPU target time,
reads out all the system registers to get the KVM reset values of those,
then creates the real VM, and feeds back in all the system register
reset values, as a method for QEMU and KVM to be in sync about the reset
state of the machine.  If we do this, and include CNTVCT, then that
would probably trigger this, but the VCPU really shouldn't have been run
at that time...

We should prevent userspace from fiddling with this register post VCPU
start regardless, but yes, it would be good to find out why this is
happening in the first place.

How did you notice this and does it manifest itself in some user-visible
ugliness?
