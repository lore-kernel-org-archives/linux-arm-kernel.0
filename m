The arm64 kernel supports several user VA space configurations (though
commonly 39 and 48-bit) and has had these from the initial port. We
realised that certain JITs (e.g.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1143022) and IIRC LLVM
assume a 47-bit user VA but AFAICT, most have been fixed.

ARMv8.1 also supports 52-bit VA (though only with 64K pages and we
haven't added support for it yet). However, it's likely that if we make
a 52-bit TASK_SIZE this the default, we will break some user
assumptions. While arguably that's not necessarily ABI, if user relies
on a 47 or 48-bit VA the kernel shouldn't break it. So I'm strongly
inclined to make the 52-bit TASK_SIZE an opt-in on arm64.
