That's a fair point.  Maybe my straw man isn't so good.

Hmm.  What if we approached this a bit differently?  We could add a
single new personality bit ADDR_LIMIT_EXPLICIT.  Setting this bit
cause PER_LINUX32_3GB etc to be automatically cleared.  When
ADDR_LIMIT_EXPLICIT is in effect, prctl can set a 64-bit numeric
limit.  If ADDR_LIMIT_EXPLICIT is cleared, the prctl value stops being
settable and reading it via prctl returns whatever is implied by the
other personality bits.
