Hi Catalin,
  sorry for the top posting. I'm struggling with QEMU cache
maintenance for devices that don't have registers cache line aligned
and may be multi-function, for lack of a better
one I thought of sp804 that supports two devices with registers
covered by one cache line. Wouldn't QEMU cache maintenance
of one device have potential to corrupt the second device?
These could be used by two guest threads in parallel.

I get bullet 2,3 still working on 1st one it will take a while.

Thanks,
- Mario
