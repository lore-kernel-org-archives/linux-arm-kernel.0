I don't understand this logic?  At least you should check if the LR
state is active or pending, sort of what vgic_unqueue_irqs does.

In fact, it looks like we can re-use the vgic_unqueue_irqs if we do
some refactoring of that function.

But why is it necessary?

why do we check the emulated target bit here?

is the right thing not to see if we're running on the physical CPU which
the physical distributor is configured to route this SPI to, and in that
case set the IRQ active to prevent it from firting?

Hmm, I'm having a hard time following this state machine, and it feels
like a hack that's papering over a design flaw, but I may just not be
able to understand it.

I'm wondering if there's an alternative approach which could work, where
we disable the IRQ on the physical distributor when the IRQ is mapped
and disabled by the guest, and then we update this state while handling
emulated writes to the GICD_I{C,S}ENABLER and loop over the disabled
bitmap for mapped interrupts on vcpu_load and vcpu_put?
