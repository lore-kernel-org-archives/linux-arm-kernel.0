Subject: [PATCH] KVM: arm/arm64: Keep mapped, disabled interrupts quiet
Message-ID: <1444307769-11400-1-git-send-email-marc.zyngier@arm.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

If a mapped interrupt is disabled, we must make sure the
corresponding physical interrupt cannot fire, as we are not
injecting the interrupt, and not setting the active bit.

For example, a guest disabling its timer interrupt at the GIC level
but leaving the timer firing would stop making progress as noone
would be able to prevent this timer from firing and interrupting
the host. Not quite what is expected. And if we're rebooting
or turning a vcpu off while the interrupt is about to fire,
we're exactly going to face this.

In order to cope with this, parse the list of mapped interrupts,
and mark it as active if we're about to run the guest (or inactive
if we've exited). Hopefully, nobody is going to run with zillions
of disabled, mapped interrupts, right?

My gut feeling is that this vgic_dist_irq_set_pending should always
be done, but I'd like some other eyes to have a look at it.

Tested on Seattle (running 4.3-rc4) with a script hammering CPU hotplug.
