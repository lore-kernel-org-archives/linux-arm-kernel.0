Ah, by PA(T)[bit_nr] you mean the value of an individual bit 'bit_nr' ?

I just think I choked on the pseudocode syntax, perhaps this is easier
to understand?

T = __virt_to_phys(__hyp_idmap_text_start)
if (T & BIT(VA_BITS - 1))
	HYP_VA_MIN = 0  //idmap in upper half
else
	HYP_VA_MIN = 1 << (VA_BITS - 1)
HYP_VA_MAX = HYP_VA_MIN + (1 << (VA_BITS - 1)) - 1

I was rambling, my suggestion above is basically what I meant.

I think we should merge the documentation, this stuff is tricky so
having it properly documented is important IMHO.

The confusing part here is that we just said above that the HYP VA range
may have to live in the upper part because the lower part would be used
for the idmap, so why can we use it anyway?

Is the point that you'll be done with the idmap at some point?

Our expectation here is that using an additional level is slower for TLB
misses, so we want to avoid this, correct?  Also does the kernel never
use 4 levels of page tables so that this is always an option.

I appreciate the tongue-in-cheek, but since this hurts my brain (badly)
I want to get rid of anything here that leaves the reader with open
questions.

I don't mind trying to rewrite some of this, just have to make sure I
actually understand it first.

So here I would simply state that using VHE, there are no separate hyp
mappings and all KVM functionality is already mapped as part of the main
kernel mappings, and none of this applies in that case.  Perhaps that's
what you said already, and I just misread it for some reason.

I would prefer if we can tweak it so I also understand it and then
actually merge it.  That also makes it easier for me to review the patch
set :)
