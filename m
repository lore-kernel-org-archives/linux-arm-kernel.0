It only means that userspace can write interrupt groups, interrupt
groups will always be supported (and writable) from the guest's point of
view with newer kernels.

An updated userspace (which writes IIDR) must know to either raise an
error if it sees a migration stream from an older QEMU or translate the
interrupt groups from 1 to 0 before writing them.

> And when interrupt-groups are not supported then writes to GICD_IGROUPR are ignored (backward compatibility)

Legacy userspace which doesn't write IIDR will not have the above logic
so to preserve migration support between an old kernel and a new kernel,
both with legacy userspace, we ignore userspace writes to the IGROUPRs
in the KVM interface for userspace which hasn't written IIDR.

Hope this helps,
