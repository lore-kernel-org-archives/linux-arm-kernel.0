Just a mistake, some magic VIM keystroke must have happenede here.

I think my reservations against this come from the fact that we're
getting farther and farther away from anything that looks like
software's interface to the GIC hardware as specified by the
architecture, and it was kind of the motivation for our choice of API
here in the first place to try to stay close to that.

That being said, what we're designing an API for here is a different
case that for what the software view of the hardware via registers has
been designed for, so potentially it's ok to deviate from that.

How about we special-case the SPENDR region, and make CPENDR region
RAZ/WI, and the SPENDR region then reflects the latch state exclusively.
Or is this more confusing than just having a separate 'fake' region?

Do you have a suggestion in mind for wording/naming of the 'latch state'
that makes sense for software people who have access to the GIC manual,
but doesn't necessarily understand how the hardware would be built and
why 'latch state' logically has clear semantics... ?

Thanks,
