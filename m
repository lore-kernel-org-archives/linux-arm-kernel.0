Sure; done.

True. I've updated the comment to say:

	/*
	 * Stash the SP (minus S_FRAME_SIZE) in tpidr_el0. We can recover the
	 * original SP value later if we need it.
	 */  

[...]

Took me a moment to spot the second instance. Fixed now.

We need the BL to ensure that the LR is valid for unwinding. That's
necessary for the backtrace to identify the exception regs based on the
LR falling into .entry.text.

The ASM_BUG() ensures that the LR value definitely falls in .entry.text,
and makes the backtrace resolve the symbol correctly regardless of
what's next.

I didn't add a comment for the other cases, so I hadn't bothered here.
I'm happy to add those, so long as we're consistent.

Thanks,
Mark.
