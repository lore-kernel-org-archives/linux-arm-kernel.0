So the idea is that whenever you're here you have one of the following
cases:

- are coming from kvm_timer_flush_hwstate, and then you exit immediately
with KVM_EXIT_INTR if needed

- you are coming from the kvm_timer_sync_hwstate just before
handle_exit.  Then if there's a vmexit you have already set
regs->kernel_timer_pending, if not you'll do a kvm_timer_flush_hwstate soon.

- you are coming from the kvm_timer_sync_hwstate in the middle of
kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run, and then "continue" will either exit the loop
immediately (if ret <= 0) or go to kvm_timer_flush_hwstate as in the
previous case

Right?

It would save the status of the line somewhere in its own variable,
without introducing a relatively delicate API between kernel and user.

I agree that you cannot update kernel_timer_pending only in
flush_hwstate; otherwise you miss on case (2) when there is a vmexit.
That has to stay in kvm_timer_sync_hwstate (or it could become a new
function called at the very end of kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run).

However, I'm not sure why user_timer_pending is necessary.  If it is
just the value you assigned to regs->kernel_timer_pending at the time of
the previous vmexit, can kvm_timer_flush_hwstate just do

   if (timer->prev_kernel_timer_pending != regs->kernel_timer_pending) {
       timer->prev_kernel_timer_pending = regs->kernel_timer_pending;
       return 1;
   }

?  Or even

   if (timer->prev_irq_level != timer->irq.level) {
       timer->prev_irq_level = regs->irq.level;
       return 1;
   }

so that regs->kernel_timer_pending remains exclusively
kvm_timer_sync_hwstate's business?

Thanks,

Paolo
