Subject: [PATCH 2/7] provide generic read_file() implementation
In-Reply-To: <1446229620-28088-1-git-send-email-andre.przywara@arm.com>

In various parts of kvmtool we simply try to read files into memory,
but fail to do so in a safe way. The read(2) syscall can return early
having only parts of the file read, or it may return -1 due to being
interrupted by a signal (in which case we should simply retry).
The ARM code seems to provide the only safe implementation, so take
that as an inspiration to provide a generic read_file() function
usable by every part of kvmtool.
