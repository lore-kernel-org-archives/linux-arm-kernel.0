To verify, we should disassemble objects from arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/*.o and
make sure we don't see absolute addresses?  I can work with Sami to get a
sense of what the before and after of this patch looks like in disassembly,
then verify those changes are pervasive.

I believe Andrey has already done this.  If he can verify (maybe during
working hours next week), then maybe we can add his Tested-by to this
patches commit message?

It's easy for us to test our kernel configs for Android, ChromeOS, and
defconfig.  I'd be curious to know the shortlist of "most useful debug
options" just to be a better kernel developer, personally.

Lets wait for Andrey to confirm his test setup.  On the Android side, I
think you should be able to get by with a released version, but I'd be
curious to hear from Andrey.

These are all reasonable. Thanks for the feedback.
