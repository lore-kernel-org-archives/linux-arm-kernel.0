you're right, I need to add a check for the level state and clear the
pnding bit in the vgic_dist_irq_clear_soft_pend() function as well.

because I apply a bitwise or operation in the caller, and I wasn't sure
if this was strictly kosher to do that on a bool, so I Googled it, and
found some reports of that going wrong on certain compilers, so I
figured better safe than sorry.

I couldn't easily dig up that resource again though.

See above.
