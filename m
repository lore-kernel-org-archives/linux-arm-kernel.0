I'm confused.  Did you send me something somewhere already?

I think it's important to run two VMs at the same time, each with some
floating-point work, and then run some floating point on the host at the
same time.

You can make that even more interesting by doing 32-bit guests at the
same time as well.

I believe Marc was running Panranoia
(http://www.netlib.org/paranoia/paranoia.c) to test the last lazy
series.

Thanks,
