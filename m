Thanks for doing this!

Not sure how to best merge the series, but for the asm-generic patch,
I'd suggest to keep it together with the follow-on patches in one
branch and merge it either through Russell's arm32 tree or through
Catalin's arm64 tree.

The easiest way would probably be to take patches 1 and 3 for arm64 in
3.17 and merge patch 2 in 3.18, unless Russell wants to see this earlier,
in which case we could have a branch that is shared between arm32 and
arm64.
