I initially advocated for a VCPU device ioctl as well, because it's a
less crowded number space that gives you more flexibility.  Marc did
have a strong point that vcpu *devices* implies something else than
features though.

I think you (a) definitely want to announce SVE support via a
capability, and (b) only set the preferred target flag if enabling SVE
*generally* gives you a VM more like the real hardware with similar
performance on some system.

I'm personally fine with both feature flags and vcpu device ioctls.  If
using vcpu device ioctls gives you an obvious way to set attributes
relating to SVE, e.g. the vector length, then I think that's a strong
argument for that approach.

Whatever you do, please document this in
Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt and related files, such as
Documentation/virtual/kvm/devices/vcpu.txt.

Thanks,
