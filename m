Well, for VHE I don't think this is any different than any other
function.  There really is no concept of 'hyp code' --- or we should aim
for there not to be --- with VHE, so if some code expects interrupts
disabled or other changes to the DAIF flags, that code should really do
that for VHE.

The rationale being that in the long run we want to keep "jumping to
hyp" the oddball legacy case, where everything else is just the
kernel/hypervisor functionality.

I think this is different for the world-switch code and the hyp code.  I
think we need a VHE-only call that masks debug exceptions before messing
with the execution context.

We could make that call, and say that kvm_call_hyp() semantically means
either "jump to special EL2 mode with the CPU configued as done when
taking an exception" or "change the current CPU mode to something that
looks like having just taken an exception and run code".  I think the
latter is a bit contrived, and we will quickly have some hidden
assumptions in our code.

I think if we have something like this:

    invalidate_vm_tlb_vhe()
    {
        local_irq_disable();
	mask_debug();
	asm("..."); /* flush stuff */
        unmask_debug();
	local_irq_enable();
    }

    invalidate_vm_tlb_nvhe()
    {
        kvm_call_hyp(__hyp_flush_stuff);
    }

    if (has_vhe())
        invalidate_vm_tlb_vhe();
    else 
    	invalidate_vm_tlb_nvhe();


It becomes more clear what our expectations are.  If we really wanted,
and we have the need to mask a certain set of exceptions, then we could
create a wrapper for that in the VHE case.

Have we actually looked at the places where we call kvm_call_hyp() and
do they require a different setting of the DAIF flags from other kernel
code running at EL2 with VHE ?

My thinking was that I don't think the kernel in general (outside of
KVM) saves the kernel's DAIF flags before doing an eret to user space
and then restores them when taking an exception back into the kernel,
does it?

If it doesn't, it must mean that the kernel knows what the DAIF flags
should be when entering from a lower exception level, and I don't
immediately understand why KVM is any different?

Is there some condition that's true when running a VM from KVM which is
not true as we are about to return from user space, for example related
to how debug is configured?

I understand that the behavior is currently different, but what I'm
asking is, instead of having to save and restore anything to the stack,
can you simply do:

     __kvm_vcpu_run(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
     {
         if (has_vhe())
             asm("msr     daifset, #0xf");

	...
        exit_code = __guest_enter(vcpu, host_ctxt);
	...

	if (has_vhe())
             asm("msr     daifclr, #0xd");
     }

(not sure about the FIQ flag - does the kernel usually 

The overall point being that we avoid a potentially unnecessary
save/restore on the stack in the critical path and we avoid potentially
unnecessary work and hidden assumptions for non-world-switch uses of
kvm_call_hyp.
