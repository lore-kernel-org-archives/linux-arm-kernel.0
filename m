 Hello!

 This perfectly works on 4.2, but will break HW interrupt forwarding on 4.3. If you look at 4.3
__kvm_vgic_sync_hwstate(), you'll notice that for HW interrupts lr_used and elrsr_ptr will diverge
at this point, and this function actually brings them into sync. And it relies on lr_used for the
loop to operate correctly (no idea why we use "for" loop here with extra check instead of
"for_each_set_bit(lr, vgic_cpu->lr_used, vgic->nr_lr)", looks stupid to me).
