It would require full TLB invalidation on entering/exiting the kernel
and again for any user access. That's because the architecture allows
this bit to be cached in the TLB so without TLBI we wouldn't have any
guarantee that the actual PAN was toggled. I'm not sure it's even clear
whether a TLBI by ASID or a local one would suffice (likely OK for the
latter).

While I don't have numbers currently, it would be hard to test on the
multitude of partner ARMv8 implementations, especially since that's not
something people would expect to optimise the hardware for.
