Well, consider that we want to move this code out of arch/arm and into
generic code - when that happens architectures should just have to
provide some data (the data to interpret the bitfields and memory
sections) to this code.

Therefore, we need pmd_large() to have the same semantics across all
architectures, and we can't use ARMs pmd_sect() - ARMs sections have
no meaning on other architectures, and the established macro which
should return true for large pages is pmd_large().

If there's the possibility for pmd_none(pmd) && pmd_large(pmd) to
return true, but the entry contains something which is not a section
descriptor, and ARM will be incompatible with other stuff and it will
stand in the way of moving this to generic code.

Really, I don't think ARM can be different with its definition of
pmd_large() even though generic code does not yet make use of this
macro.
