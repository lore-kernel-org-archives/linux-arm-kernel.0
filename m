Oh.  When someone posted wiring up of syscalls on Alpha some time
back I raised a query about seccomp then someone else (I can't be
bothered looking up the old emails, it doesn't really matter)
said bpf was in the same basket, so the patch was re-submitted with
neither of those syscalls.

We have got way behind on syscalls on Alpha and I was just in the
process of wiring them up and testing them, so I will include both
seccomp and bpf in that.

Cheers
