Congratulations, I think you're now ready to try deciphering my
handwriting... ;-)

Indeed. We still need it for edge interrupts though. I'll try to find a
nicer way...

Yup, there is something that doesn't quite work here.

I think the mistake is to sample the distributor active state. I wonder
if I can simply rely on the LR state. If it is neither pending nor
active, it means that we have done the deactivation, and we can then
reset the queued state.

As a bonus, it would save a read from MMIO, which is often dog slow.

Thoughts?
