Yes, that makes sense. For the UEFI stub version of the randomization,
that is trivially achievable, since we already parse the command line
in that context. For the bare bootloader case, that is a bit more
involved, since we'd need to parse the FDT before applying the
relocations, or apply the relocations twice.

I will look into all of these. kexec support has been in flight for a
while now, but I have no idea when it is expected to land.

Well, I conveniently punted the RNG problem to the firmware, so as far
as the quality of the randomness is concerned, it is easy to shift the
blame. For the other stuff (including the quality of the translation
between a random number and a KASRL offset), I highly appreciate your
input.
