What part of the spec are you referring to?

A virtual interrupt, even backed by a HW interrupt, does have an active
state (unless it is an LPI). The only state we cannot observe in the LR
when the HW bit is set is the Active+Pending state because the pending
bit is then at the physical distributor level.

For all intent and purposes, the active state in the LR behaves the
same, irrespective of the HW state, until the guest issues a
deactivation (either using EOI or DIR, depending on EOImode).
