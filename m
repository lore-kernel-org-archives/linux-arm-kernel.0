This works on x86 and ARM (AArch32 and eventually AArch64 without VHE). What this means in ARM, is that Jailhouse hooks into the HVC stub exposed by Linux, and happily installs itself in EL2.

Then we would also have to deal with the intricacies of removing and re-adding vCPUs to the Linux root cell, so we would have to maintain the illusion of running in EL2 for each one of them.

Without knowing any of the details, I would say there are two strategies
regarding this:

- Disable KVM support in the Linux kernel - then we shouldn't boot into
  EL2 in the first place, should we?

- Emulate what Linux is missing after take-over by Jailhouse (we do
  this on x86 with VT-d interrupt remapping which cannot be disabled
  anymore for Linux once it started with it, and we cannot boot without
  it when we want to use the x2APIC).
