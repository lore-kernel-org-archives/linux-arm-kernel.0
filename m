This separation might also help in future with code consolidation across
different architectures. It was suggested that ARM DMA bounce code has a lot
in common with SWIOTBL (if I'm right) dma-mapping implementation.

The separation will also help in integrating the IOMMU based dma-mapping,
which will probably share again some code with linear dma-mapping code.
Having these 3 implementations mixed together might not help in code
readability.
