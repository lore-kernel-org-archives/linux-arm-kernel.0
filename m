I agree, though there are few direct users of this API, and I couldn't
come up with a scenario where anyone in their right mind would access
the core regs struct with access sizes <= 16 bits, and I've seen no
evidence so far of the API being used in this way.

So it would be nice to close this hole before it springs a leak.

I'll keep if for now, but flag it up for attention in the repost.
I'm happy to drop it if people care strongly enough.

Hint taken...  I'll add a comment.  No doubt I'd eventually forget why 
the BUILD_BUG_ON() was there too.

It's a bit tricky to get right, because it all depends on the
combination of types being used in the expression.

I might have a think about how to do this, but for now I don't want to
introduce more churn.
