The architecture requires this for *all* levels of page table, when
certain changes are made. Switching an entry from a table to block (or
vice versa) is one of those changes, and this definitely applies to
PMDs.

This is in ioremap code. Under what workload does this constitute a perf
hit?

Regardless, so long as we mark the pmd entry invalid before the TLB
invalidation, we don't need to touch the next level table at all. We
just require a sequence like:

	pmd_clear(*pmdp);
	flush_tlb_kernel_range(pmd_start_addr, pmd_end_addr);
	pmd_set_huge(*pmdp, phys, prot);

Sorry, I don't follow. Could you elaborate on the problem?

Retaining a valid PMD in the TLB that *differs* from a valid PMD in the
page tables is a big problem.

The architecture requires BBM, as this permits CPUs to allocate PMDs
into TLBs at *any* time, even if there's already PMD in the TLB for a
given address.

Thus, CPUs can allocate *both* valid PMDs into the TLBs. When this
happens, a TLB lookup can:

1) return either of the PMDs.

2) raise a TLB conflict abort.

3) return an amalgamation of the two entries (e.g. provide an erroneous
   address).

Note that (3) is particularly scary:

* The CPU could raise an SError if the amalgamated entry is junk.

* If a memory access hits an amalgamated entry, it may use the wrong
  physical address, attributes, or permissions, resulting in a number of
  potential problems.

* If the amalgamated entry looks like a partial walk, the TLB might try
  to perform a walk starting at the physical address in the amalgamated
  entry. This would cause page table walks to access bogus addresses,
  allocating junk into TLBs, and may result in SErrors or other aborts.

Please see above.

While this may happen to work on particular platforms, it is not
guaranteed per the architecture, and will fail on others.

Thanks,
Mark.
