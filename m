With KASLR disabled, I think we should aim for the existing behaviour as
much as possible. The original aim of these patches was to relax the
kernel image placement rules, to make it easier for boot loaders rather
than completely randomising it.

With KASLR enabled, I agree it's hard to make any assumptions about what
memory is available. But removing memory only from the top would also
help with the point you already raised - keeping lower memory for
devices with narrower DMA mask.
