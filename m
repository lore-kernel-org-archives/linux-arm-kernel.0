A57 to A53 is probably a bad example because we actively support both.
So let's replace your A57 with an A72. With this patch, the A72 would be
reported as "generic CPU", and MIDR access would fail on the A53.

Admittedly, this is a bit late. We could also refuse to instantiate a
"generic CPU" on A53, but that's not much better timing wise.

Not sure we can do much better though.
