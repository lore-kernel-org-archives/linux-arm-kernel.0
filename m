OK. I will only update the QEMU code then.

For info, without talking about save/restore, the GICR_PENDBASER is
sync'ed on LPI enable. if the vITS gets an error on kvm_read_guest, we
currently abort the sync without reporting any error.

GICR_PROPBASER is read on cmd execution (MAPI, INV, INVALL). No error is
reported at the moment. My understanding is our implementation chose the
3d alternative of GICV3 arch spec (6.3.2), ie. "the data that generated
the error or errors is treated as having a legal value",  increment the
read cursor and currently we don't report any system error to the guest.

Thanks

Eric
