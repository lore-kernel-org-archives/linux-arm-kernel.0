I think we had this discussion before, I am happy to use a wording that
makes everyone happy ;-)
I already changed it to "_Contains_ the address" to note that it's the
whole register, but that holding the _address_ is the actual purpose of
PROPBASER. A less unambiguous comment is warmly welcomed ...

Yes, that's what it does, though I am not sure that explanation is more
meaningful, as it describes the code, but not the intention of it.
The main purpose of that function is to allow updates of one half of a
register while keeping the other half intact.

Every GIC register that can be accessed as 64-bit can only be 32-bit as
well, so we don't need any byte or halfword handling.
Containing this function to these two cases made it simpler (though this
is admittedly not obvious ;-)

I forgot, I think there was a function, but that had issues as well, IIRC.

The idea is to make val naturally the largest possible type that could
be subject to MMIO operations and also to let it match the type used in
the MMIO handlers.
This was with 32-bit support already in mind.

Then let me fix this before you get into any trouble ...

OK, can do.

Possibly. The latest public version is issue B from December 2015, and
IIRC this was one of the changes.

Good point! A rather easy fix would be to use a local variable here and
do just one update at the end.  A more involved one to use per-VCPU
propbaser variables. But eventually we only need _one_ value and don't
have a VCPU pointer when we need to access the value.

  ^^^^
I am biting my lips on that matter ;-)

More seriously, I don't think this is a problem, since this is specified
as "undefined". So if I am not mistaken we can happily go on with
changing the value anyway. Any illegal value should be caught by
kvm_read_guest().

pendbaser is per core, propbaser is one value per ITS eventually.
So the propbaser initialisation is in vgic_its_create() in patch 11/17.

Thanks again for the comments!
