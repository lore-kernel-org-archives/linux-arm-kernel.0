Yeah, another level of BL braindeadness. We should have some API to
match the PMU we want on the CPU we're on at the moment that trap occurs.

I don't think this should block this series though - this is something
we can improve on in parallel (a possible solution being to forbid KVM
on BL platform altogether).
