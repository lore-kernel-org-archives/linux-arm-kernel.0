I don't seee traps.c there. Don't we need to fix up do_sysinstr() (which
performs raw cache maintenance ops on __user addresses) with
uaccess_{enable,disable}_not_uao()?

Likewise, how do we handle __flush_cache_user_range and
flush_icache_range? Some callers (e.g. __do_compat_cache_op) pass in
__user addresses.

I hope we have some tests lying around for those. ;)

Thanks,
Mark.
