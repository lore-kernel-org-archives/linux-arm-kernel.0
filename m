This is (mostly) correct. Because we deal with HW that is shared between
guests, we absolutely need to make that HW quiescent before getting back
to the host. Setting the active bit in the distributor allows us to
restore the HW in a state that shows a pending interrupt at the guest
level, but ensure that the interrupt doesn't fire at the host level.

As for the "specificity", this is how the architecture has been
designed, and the way we're expected to deal with this kind of shared
HW. Rest assured I didn't come up with that on my own! ;-)

That's because it is illegal to set a HW interrupt to be PENDING+ACTIVE,
which means we have to prevent the interrupt to be injected multiple
times. The behaviour is sufficiently close to what we do for a level
interrupt that we use the same state.

I tried to keep the HW bit madness as localized as possible. Letting it
spread further away seems to make the code more difficult to read IMHO.

Shared devices cannot be left running when the guest is not running
because (a) we have lost the context (the guest), and (b) we need to
give it to another guest. This is a fundamental property of this kind of
resource.

This is by no mean specific to the timer, BTW. The VGIC itself is a
shared resource, and we nuke it on each exit, for the same reason. The
only difference is that we don't propagate the VGIC interrupt to a guest.

As explained above, we have the same requirements when an interrupt is
forwarded to a guest.
