That was lazy language on my part.  I'll try to explain it better:

When the saved state of a migrating vcpu is being loaded into a
newly-created vcpu on the target node, userspace needs a way to
ensure that the set of VLs that vcpu will see when it runs is
_exactly_ the same set it could see before migration.

I called this out separately because it's different from the
case of creating a brand-new VM: in the latter case, we can't the
kernel to provide the best set of VLs possible, but it is not an
error not to get every VL we asked for.

OK, I'll go with changing the supplied vqs for KVM_ARM_SVE_SET_VLS,
but I'll retain the -ERANGE semantics (even if technically redundant)
since that's harder to forget to check.

OK.  Thanks for the input.
