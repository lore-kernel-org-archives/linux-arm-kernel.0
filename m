I think you want to hide ZCR_EL1 if SVE is not enabled, since presenting
it to a legacy userspace will prevent migration onto a non-SVE enabled
kernel/machine.

Just so I understand; slice 0 covers all the SVE state as the SVE spec
is today.  Additional slices is something we can use in the future in
case the SVE spec is expanded to allow even larger vector lengths?  In
which case, for a hypothetical 4096 bits register, slice 0 of Zn will be
the lower 2048 bits and slice 1 will be the upper 2048 bits?

This implies that there are some ordering fun to be had between
accessing SVE registers and changing the maximum vector length for the
vcpu.  Why not loosen the API slightly and say that anything written to
the surplus bits is not guaranteed to be preserved when read back?  (In
other words, we make no guarantees).

nit: KVM_REG_ARM_CORE_REG doesn't specify the size, so I think this
would be more clearly stated as
"aliases KVM_REG_SIZE_U128 | KVM_REG_ARM_CORE(fp_regs.vregs[n])" or as
"aliases kvm_regs.regs.fp_regs.vregs[n]".

It's not going to be a big deal, and it's the only sensible thing to do;
otherwise we'll have no clear semantics of where the values are.  If KVM
chooses to duplicate the 128 bits of state in memory, then it must also
know how to syncrhonize that duplicated state when running the guest,
and therefore can also do this in software on SET/GET.

I don't understand the proposed semantics here.  What is the vqs array
and how should the values be set?

That's fine.

I think we should have such a way.  Libvirt can do things like figure
out compatible features across nodes, and trying to set all possible
vector lengths doesn't seem like a great approach.

How about creating the interface based on a bitmap of all the possible
lengths, and setting the bits for all lengths, and reading back the
value returns the actual supported lengths?

My comments above are really in the details so I think you can safely
start putting together a full implementation, assuming this is still
your plan.
