This is a good point, and one that I don't have an answer for yet.

POSIX[1] says that sigaltstack() _shall_ return EPERM if ss_size
< MINSIGSTKSZ.

I don't know the full rationale behind this.

The ENOMEM return here doesn't guarantee that signal delivery will
definitely fail or compromise safety when ss_size or less of stack is
available.

A 0 return doesn't guarantee that signal delivery on the registered
alternate stack will succeed or be safe.

So while the ENOMEM return has some sanity-check value, it's very
limited in its usefulness.


I currently saw no good reason to misrepresent the true signal frame
size in AT_MINSIGSTKSZ, so it is currently a precise value that can be
< MINSIGSTKSZ (and is, in the default case).

In an ideal world, my preference would be to relax the check in
sigaltstack() to check >= AT_MINSIGSTKSZ, but it is technically an ABI
break...


We _could_ paper over this by rounding up the AT_MINSIGSTKSZ value
reported by the kernel to be always >= MINSIGSTKSZ.  This seems ugly,
but may be the most pragmatic option.


Thoughts?
