I think your patches look fine, and I agree with your suggestions on
improving the hyp ABI and documenting it.

Marc found a small problem for KVM with your patch and offered a simple
fix.  I don't really see a bigger problem here?

Sorry about my silence, I was really busy leading up to Christmas and
was offline for most of the Christmas and new years days.

I've gone back over the thread and haven't been able to spot anything
that wasn't already answered by Marc (who also maintains KVM so would be
one of the KVM people).  Could you let me know which questions remain
unanswered and I can try to help?

I think the hyp stub has just served a very limited purpose so far, and
therefore is a somewhat immature implementation.  Now we've discovered a
need to clean it up, and we're all for that.  Again, I don't think the
problem is any larger than that, we just need to fix it, and it seems to
me everyone is willing to work on that.  Marc even offered to work on
your suggestion to support the general hyp ABI commands in KVM.

I think we should try to separate the discussion of fixing an immediate
problem with the hyp code, and that of how to maintain things.  I think
we're already on the right track to fix the former.

Before we start changing up maintainerships (which I personally think
work fine as it is) I would encourage you to just comment on patches
touching arch/arm that you are unhappy with.

We have been cc'ing all our changes to lakml and we've tried to cc you
specifically on anything touching arch/arm, and we will listen to any
suggestions you may have.

Thanks,
-Christoffer
