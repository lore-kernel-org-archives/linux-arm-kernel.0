Interestingly, this is essentially how I implemented it for arm64. It
boots to the point where it can retrieve the kaslr-seed from the DT
(and the 'nokaslr' command line argument), and either proceeds (if
there is no seed or nokaslr is passed), or it returns to the startup
code and remaps the kernel at a randomized offset.

However, the configurations are very different. The arm64 kernel
mappings are disjoint from the kernel's direct mapping, and the
physical offset is under the control of the bootloader anyway. So when
it returns to the startup code, it only updates the virtual mapping
not the physical placement.

I will try to come up with something that makes it more self contained.
