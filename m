Ah sorry, got ahead of myself ;-p.  You can safely take this patch
through your tree.  The ia64 patch can happen asynchronously because
kernel/memremap.c has:

__weak void *arch_memremap(resource_size_t offset, size_t size,
unsigned long flags)

...as a temporary fallback until the conversion is complete.
