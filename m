We would need that to complete the maintenance, yes.

However, given we're going into WFI immediately afterwards, and not
signalling completion to other CPUs, what we gain is somewhat
questionable.

Perhaps it's always better to do the maintenance on the read side (for
consistency with [1]).

Regardless, we'd probably want a DSB to ensure the write had
completed...

Mark.
