Sorry, It's my mistake.

To my best knowledge, to defend 'KSMA', we need to handle these
configurations:

1. ARM64_4K_PAGES && ARM64_VA_BITS_39 (PGTABLE_LEVELS = 3, 1GB block)
2. ARM64_16K_PAGES && ARM64_VA_BITS_36 (PGTABLE_LEVELS = 2, 32MB block)
3. ARM64_64K_PAGES && ARM64_VA_BITS_42 (PGTABLE_LEVELS = 2, 512MB block)

If these configurations are selected, we move {idmap_pg_dir,
tramp_pg_dir, reserved_ttbr0, swapper_pg_dir} to .rodata section(avoid
modifying tramp_(un)map_kernel), and remap swapper_pg_dir r/w for updates.
If these configurations are not selected, we just keep them as they are.

Do you think this is okay?
