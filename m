Subject: [PATCH v11 0/4] set VSESR_EL2 by user space and support NOTIFY_SEI
 notification
Message-ID: <1523309796-36423-1-git-send-email-gengdongjiu@huawei.com>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

1. Detect whether KVM can set set guest SError syndrome
2. Support to Set VSESR_EL2 and inject SError by user space.
3. Support live migration to keep SError pending state and VSESR_EL2 value.
4. ACPI 6.1 adds support for NOTIFY_SEI as a GHES notification mechanism, so support this
   notification in software, KVM or kernel ARCH code call handle_guest_sei() to let ACP driver
   to handle this notification.

Change since V10:

Address James's comments, thanks James
1. Merge the helper function with the user.
2. Move the ISS_MASK into pend_guest_serror() to clear top bits
3. Make kvm_vcpu_events struct align to 4 bytes
4. Add something check in the kvm_arm_vcpu_set_events()
5. Check kvm_arm_vcpu_get/set_events()'s return value.
6. Initialise kvm_vcpu_events to 0 so that padding transferred to user-space doesn't
    contain kernel stack.

Dongjiu Geng (4):
  arm64: KVM: export the capability to set guest SError syndrome
  arm/arm64: KVM: Add KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS
  ACPI / APEI: Add SEI notification type support for ARMv8
  arm64: handle NOTIFY_SEI notification by the APEI driver
