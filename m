Provided we've already marked the host FPSIMD state as dirty on the way
in, we probably don't need to restore it here.

In v4.15, the kvm_fpsimd_flush_cpu_state() call in
kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() is supposed to do this marking: currently
it's only done for SVE, since KVM was previously restoring the host
FPSIMD subset of the state anyway, but it could be made unconditional.

For a returning run ioctl, this would have the effect of deferring the
host FPSIMD reload until we return to userspace, which is probably
no more costly since the kernel must check whether to do this in
ret_to_user anyway; OTOH if the vcpu thread was preempted by some
other thread we save the cost of restoring the host state entirely here
... I think.

Ultimately I'd like to go one better and actually treat a vcpu as a
first-class fpsimd context, so that taking an interrupt to the host
and then reentering the guest doesn't cause any reload at all.  But
that feels like too big a step for this series, and there are likely
side-issues I've not thought about yet.

Cheers
