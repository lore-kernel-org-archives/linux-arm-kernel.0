[NOTE: Adding the linux-arm folks to this thread just in case they are
interested.]

I'm not an ARM expert, but the kernel #define for AUDIT_ARCH_ARMEB
(below) seems reasonable to me based on the other audit machine
definitions.  There is clearly a mismatch between the kernel and the
audit userspace, but I wonder if the issue should be addressed in the
userspace tools.  Further, you mention kernel 3.14, what happens with
kernel 3.19 and the most recent audit userspace tools?

  #define AUDIT_ARCH_ARMEB        (EM_ARM)
