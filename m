Subject: [RFC/PoC PATCH 0/3] arm64: basic ROP mitigation
Message-ID: <20180802132133.23999-1-ard.biesheuvel@linaro.org>

This is a proof of concept I cooked up, primarily to trigger a discussion
about whether there is a point to doing anything like this, and if there
is, what the pitfalls are. Also, while I am not aware of any similar
implementations, the idea is so simple that I would be surprised if nobody
else thought of the same thing way before I did.

The idea is that we can significantly limit the kernel's attack surface
for ROP based attacks by clearing the stack pointer's sign bit before
returning from a function, and setting it again right after proceeding
from the [expected] return address. This should make it much more difficult
to return to arbitrary gadgets, given that they rely on being chained to
the next via a return address popped off the stack, and this is difficult
when the stack pointer is invalid.

Of course, 4 additional instructions per function return is not exactly
for free, but they are just movs and adds, and leaf functions are
disregarded unless they allocate a stack frame (this comes for free
because simple_return insns are disregarded by the plugin)

Please shoot, preferably with better ideas ...

Ard Biesheuvel (3):
  arm64: use wrapper macro for bl/blx instructions from asm code
  gcc: plugins: add ROP shield plugin for arm64
  arm64: enable ROP protection by clearing SP bit #55 across function
    returns
