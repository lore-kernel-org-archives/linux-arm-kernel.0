Subject: [PATCH v2 10/10] ARM: dts: sun9i: Switch to the AC100 RTC clock
 outputs for osc32k
In-Reply-To: <1465986467-14802-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
References: <1465986467-14802-1-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
Message-ID: <1465986467-14802-11-git-send-email-wens@csie.org>
To: linux-arm-kernel@lists.infradead.org
List-Id: linux-arm-kernel.lists.infradead.org

The 32.768 kHz clock inside the A80 SoC is fed from an external source,
typically the AC100 RTC module.

Make the osc32k placeholder a fixed-factor clock so board dts files can
specify its source.
