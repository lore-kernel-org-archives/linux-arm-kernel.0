Hi Paolo and Radim,

Here is the initial set of changes for KVM/ARM for v4.7.

Sorry I'm a bit late with these, but we were trying to get the new vgic
implementation in as part of this, but I have decided to send this pull
request now, and we can follow up with another for the new VGIC,
assuming we feel like we have that in place in a few days.

There are a few changes in this pull request touching things outside
KVM, but they should all carry the necessary acks and it made the
merge process much easier to do it this way.

Hope this works for you guys.

  kvm: arm64: Enable hardware updates of the Access Flag for Stage 2 page tables (2016-05-09 22:23:08 +0200)


Thanks,

KVM/ARM Changes for Linux v4.7

Reworks our stage 2 page table handling to have page table manipulation
macros separate from those of the host systems as the underlying
hardware page tables can be configured to be noticably different in
layout from the stage 1 page tables used by the host.

Adds 16K page size support based on the above.

Adds a generic firmware probing layer for the timer and GIC so that KVM
initializes using the same logic based on both ACPI and FDT.

Finally adds support for hardware updating of the access flag.
