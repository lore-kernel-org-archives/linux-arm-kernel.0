I'd rather have something that is per register (after all, there is only
a handful). It will make the code readable (and it is so trivial that
the compiler will inline it anyway).

Yeah, I missed the first line. Your GIC_CACHE_PROP_ATTR() macros are
really getting in the way here. I'd prefer to see each register accessor
doing its own "sanitisation" in situ, without some fake sharing of code.

Careful, that's about to change. And don't mind reporting *any* value,
as long as it is cacheable.

Well, you say "redist_baser". To me, that's a redistributor, not an ITS
register. just drop these functions, and do it in each accessor.
Everything will become much more readable.
