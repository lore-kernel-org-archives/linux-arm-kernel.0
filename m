understand your meaning.

ARM James ever have below comments about the table generation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But you can use APEI in a guest on CPUs without the RAS extensions: the host may
signal memory errors to Qemu for any number of reasons, user-space shouldn't
care how it knows. Examples are PCI-AER, any APEI event notified by polling or
one of the flavours of irq.

I would expect Qemu to generate a HEST based on its abilities, i.e. if it
supports any mechanism of notifying the guest about errors. Choosing the
mechanism then depends on the type of error.

Ideally the Qemu code for HEST/GHES/CPER generation code using some of the irqs
and polling could be shared with x86, as these should be possible using common
KVM APIs.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He means we can use APEI on CPUs without RAS and may be share this code with x86,
if Qemu can support any mechanism of notifying the guest about errors, it should be
generate the table.
Now we depend on the macro KVM_HAVE_MCE_INJECTION to decide whether Qemu can support
notifying the guest.

what do you think which we should be dependent on to generate the table?

ok.
