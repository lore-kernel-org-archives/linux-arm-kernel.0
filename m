It is _not_ safe to hold the lock while calling callbacks.

Please refer to the DMA engine documentation, found here:

Documentation/dmaengine.txt

section 3:

   Note:
        Although the async_tx API specifies that completion callback
        routines cannot submit any new operations, this is not the
        case for slave/cyclic DMA.

        For slave DMA, the subsequent transaction may not be available
        for submission prior to callback function being invoked, so
        slave DMA callbacks are permitted to prepare and submit a new
        transaction.

        For cyclic DMA, a callback function may wish to terminate the
        DMA via dmaengine_terminate_all().

*       Therefore, it is important that DMA engine drivers drop any
*       locks before calling the callback function which may cause a
*       deadlock.

        Note that callbacks will always be invoked from the DMA
        engines tasklet, never from interrupt context.
