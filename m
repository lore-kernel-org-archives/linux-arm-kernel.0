Subject: [PATCHv3 0/6] Add I2C support for Allwinner SoCs

Hi,

This patchset adds support for the I2C controller found on most of the
Allwinner SoCs, especially the already supported A10 and A13, and the
yet to come A31.

It has been tested on a A13-Olinuxino.

Thanks,
Maxime

Changes from v2:
  * Slightly modified the switch comments again
  * Removed the of_* calls in favor of platform_get_* functions

Changes from v1:
  * Added comments to the switch statements to clarify when the fall through to
    the next case is made on purpose
  * Use devm_ioremap_resource instead of of_iomap
  * Moved the reset after enabling the clocks
  * Added Emilio Lopez' patch to add the available i2c controllers to the
    cubieboard
