Ah, it was an exception handler, but the one I was thinking of was this:

That's fair, but what I'm trying to say is that many people will want
this, so rejecting it because it's 2 more instructions seems
unreasonable. We have had much more invasive changes added to the
kernel.

Fine, but this is splitting hairs. This does protect a specific
situation, and it does so very cheaply. The real fix would be to
remove set_fs() entirely. :P
